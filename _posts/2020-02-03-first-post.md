Welcome to the new Residence Life and Housing Parent Blog!  Every other week, we will strengthen our partnership with parents by providing information on relevant issues that shape your students’ experiences at UMW.  Topics will include ways to appreciate your RA, navigating the “will you be my roommate next year” and the “I don’t want to be your roommate next year” conversations, general housing selection, registering for classes, preparing to depart UMW for the summer, and more!  It is our hope that these blog posts, written by our Residence Life professionals, will offer additional insight and clarity as you support your student through their on-campus living experience.

Let us start our first post with an introduction to our Residence Life and Housing professional team!
