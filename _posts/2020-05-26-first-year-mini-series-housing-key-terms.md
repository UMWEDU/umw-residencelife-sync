Congrats on becoming a UMW Eagle parent! Today’s post will discuss first-year housing as well as key terms you will hear during your student's time at UMW.
<h3 style="text-align: center">Housing</h3>
First-year students will live in designated first-year residence halls determined by their First Year Seminar Course (FSEM). We call these <em>Living Learning Communities</em>. These first-year residence halls are: Marshall Hall, Mason Hall, Randolph Hall, Russell Hall, and Willard Hall. First-year students will typically live in double rooms with one roommate.

*UMW is currently working on COVID-19 planning for Fall 2020. Depending on recommendations/requirements from the Governor’s office, housing at UMW may have to change. We will keep you posted on any developments.

<u>Housing Assignment</u>

The housing assignment will tell you exactly where your student will be living in the fall. Housing assignments will be sent to students via their UMW email address. When they receive their housing assignment, it will be formatted like this: <strong>Willard Hall, WIL-100A-1. </strong>See below for what each part of the housing assignment means.

<strong>Residence Hall, Residence Hall Abbreviation-Residence Hall Room-Individual Room Space</strong>

<strong>WIL</strong>: Residence hall abbreviation. The residence hall is Willard Hall.

<strong>100A</strong>: Residence hall room number. The room number is 100. (When your student becomes an upperclass student (after their first year) and they choose to live in the UMW Apartments or Eagle Landing, you will see A, B, and C used to further designate their room within the apartment. So, 100A is apartment 100, room A.)

<strong>1</strong>: Individual room space. They are in the first individual space within the room. (In the context of this example, the roommate would have the housing assignment “WIL-100A-2” which indicates they are assigned to the second individual bed space within the room. The room spaces are not indicated within the physical room.)

<u>Roommates</u>

Students who indicated a preferred roommate within their housing application by May 15<sup>th</sup> will receive housing assignments in a residence hall room together. If your student indicate(d) a preferred roommate after this date, we will still make every effort to place the two of them in a room together.

<h3 style="text-align: center">Key College Terms</h3>
You may hear your student say “Can you put some money on my EagleOne?” or “I’ll check with my RA.” Unless you know what an EagleOne is or what RA means, it could be a confusing conversation. Today we are here to give you a few simple terms to beat that confusion and empower you and your student.
