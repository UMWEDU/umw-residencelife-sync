<span style="color: #000000">Eating cold pizza and instant roman is slowly becoming a thing of the past; when it comes down to eating and cooking in a Residence Hall. At UMW each residence hall outside of Russell has a full kitchen where students will be able to cook their meals. There are also small kitchenettes where microwaves are located. These spaces are still available, but to minimize risk the way we utilize them will be different. When students arrive during move-in, they will be given a token. The token will be used to hang up in community spaces such as the kitchen. Spaces like the kitchen will have a set number for occupancy to help practice social distancing. By looking at the token’s students will know if space is being used and how many are in that space.</span>

<span style="color: #000000">After the student knows that the kitchen is available it’s time for them to challenge Bobby Flay! Students will need to bring their own pots, pans, and utensils for cooking. They must wash their own items and store them in their room. Students will have access to a stove, oven, and all the necessary things to make whatever their hearts desire. Students need to focus and keep a close eye on what they are cooking till it is completely done and all the appliances are turned off. Then, they should clean all areas of the kitchen and make sure it's like new for the next person. Cooking in a Residence hall gives that feeling of independence and being at home. Never the less cooking meals take time and can be hard for students and their busy schedules, so making sure they have a good meal plan always helps and comes and handy when things get a little hot in the kitchen. HAHA, they burn the food!</span>

<span style="color: #000000"> Below are some quick and easy recipes to share with your student.</span>
