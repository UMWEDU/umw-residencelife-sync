<span style="color: #000000">            An important part of living on campus, is getting involved. Living on campus gives students to engage more with the resources and opportunities that exist on the campus. Although, this year, getting involved on campus will look different, it is still vital to having a great college experience. To help your student get involved, here are some things to get involved in within the halls, right now and in the future.</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="color: #000000">Association of Residence Halls: This is an organization that works to create meaningful programming and advocate for what residential students want on campus. This organization is operating year-round and always looking for members who want to get involved as their halls representative or even executive board members. If you have more questions you can reach out to either the ARH email, <a style="color: #000000" href="mailto:umwarh@gmail.com">umwarh@gmail.com</a>, or their advisor, <a style="color: #000000" href="mailto:mbrown29@umw.edu">mbrown29@umw.edu</a></span></li>
 	<li><span style="color: #000000">Themed Living Communities: These are an opportunity for upperclassmen to live with people with same interest as them. Currently the themed living communities at UMW are Ecovillage, Substance Free UMW, and the International Living Center. But, it is easy for students to create one if they have a group of friends with the same interest who want to live together. More information can be found <a style="color: #000000" href="https://www.umw.edu/residencelife/on-campus/life/tlcs/">here</a>.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="color: #000000">Spring RA Selection: An amazing way to get involved with living on campus, is becoming a Resident Assistant! The RA position will have your student be a leader in the hall they live in, as well as work to build community with their residents. Residential Life and Housing typically starts the RA selection process for the following year in the spring. IF your student is interested in the position, then be on the lookout for information from Residential Life about this process! If you have any questions, tell your student to ask their RA or their Area Coordinator.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="color: #000000">RA Programming: Our Resident Assistants put on a lot of fun programs throughout the year to engage their residents in the community. Make sure to tell your student to check their communities canvas page to see what is happening!</span></li>
