The storm of COVID -19 was not one that we could predict. As a university, we strive to give our students the best education, but most importantly all the support that UMW has to offer. To keep up that standard, it’s our job to inform the students and their biggest support system, YOU, through these tough and confusing times. We would like to give you some tips and ideas to help your students navigate through this new remote experience.
<h4><strong>Communication</strong></h4>
Communication is very important at this time. There are different lines of communication you want to make sure that your student is involved or aware of.

<strong><em>Student to guardian</em></strong>: This communication is the most important. As the major support system in the student’s life, have conversations and try and understand what they need and how this experience is affecting them. Late graduation, canceled internships, missing friends could be a few topics that could be running through the mind of your student. Keep an open line of communication with your student to express issues such as these with you. During that time, listen and do your best to reassure them that things will work out. Make sure your student creates a schedule and plans out their day so that they can get the most out of every day and finish the semester strong.

<strong><em>Student to University</em></strong>: With UMW, we are making sure students have the ability to know what is going on but also ask questions. Things like Q &amp; A with the President have been hosted, information on the main website is also being updated regularly, and emails are going out frequently. Emails are the biggest line of communication. Information about Housing Selection for fall 2020, refunds, grading options, and more are being communicated through that channel. For example, our department sent out an email on April 6th about how the process of belonging retrieval for students who still have items left in their residence hall will go.

Please make sure your students are checking and reading emails regularly throughout the day, and if they have questions to reach out the same way.

<strong><em>Student to student</em></strong>: Encourage your student to continue to build relationships with their peers. UMW has created different channels, through the office of Student Activity &amp; Engagement and our department, for students and residents to interact with their current community and also have the ability to create new relationships. One way that students are able to engage with each other is with the social media platforms created by their RA.
<h4><strong>Healthy habits for remote learning</strong></h4>
Below are some things that you and your student can work together to create a healthy body, mind, and atmosphere through the remote learning process.
<ul>
 	<li>If students need a break to relax or an environment to clear their head, their room is normally the place. Help your student to identify a clear workplace outside of their room (if possible) to give the student a sense of separation from school.</li>
 	<li>With social distancing being practiced, encourage your student to go outside for a walk or do other outside activities.</li>
 	<li>Make sure that your student is getting a quality amount of sleep and performing proper sleeping habits.</li>
 	<li>Have scheduled family time to allow everyone to talk and interact with each other: Netflix movie, board games, or a simple conversation.</li>
 	<li>Allow alone time for your student and for yourself.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

All UMW students are different, but the one thing that they have in common is a supportive university and an even stronger supporter in YOU. Practice those healthy habits and make sure your student knows about the lines of communication. The most important thing is to listen to them and be there. I hope these tips and ideas have given you a better understanding of how to support your student through the storm. We will get through this together!
