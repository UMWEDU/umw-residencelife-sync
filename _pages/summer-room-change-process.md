<strong>Following the housing selection process each spring we have a small percentage of individuals who have a housing assignment but would prefer a different assignment.  These upperclass students may choose to participate in the Summer Room Change Process.</strong>

<strong>Deadline to submit Summer Room Change form is May 1, 2016. </strong>

Over the summer Residence Life staff members work to reassign students into their preferred housing assignment.  Given limited availability of spaces following housing selection this is not always possible.

Do not submit the Summer Room Change form if:
<ul>
	<li>You are experiencing roommate concerns. Instead, follow the <a href="http://www.umw.edu/residencelife/on-campus/housing-procedures/changes/">Changes to Housing Assignments</a> process.</li>
	<li>You are a Commuter Student who has decided you would like to live on campus in the fall. Instead, contact Brittany Harper at <a href="mailto:bharper2@umw.edu">bharper2@umw.edu</a>.</li>
	<li>You are an incoming first year or transfer student.  Instead, contact Brittany Harper at <a href="mailto:bharper2@umw.edu">bharper2@umw.edu</a>.</li>
</ul>
To participate in the Summer Room Change Process, complete the <a href="https://orgsync.com/59554/forms/192772">Summer Room Change form</a>.
