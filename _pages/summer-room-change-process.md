In the past, Residence Life has permitted room changes over the summer for the upcoming academic year's housing assignments.

However, this year we have changed the process and encourage you to work with the Area Coordinator in your Fall assigned building <strong>after</strong> the first two (2) weeks of the Fall semester.
