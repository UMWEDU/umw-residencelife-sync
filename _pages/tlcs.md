<h2>Themed Living Communities for Upperclass Students</h2>
<h3>It's time to add some TLC to your home at UMW!</h3>
UMW’s Themed Living Communities (T.L.C.) provide upper-class students with the opportunity to live together and further engage in learning outside of the classroom.  Themed Living Communities offer students the chance to bond with their peers through opportunities for small group discussion and reflection on topics of common interest while providing unique experiences to connect with faculty, staff, and community leaders!

Themed Living Communities integrate academics, career preparedness, leadership, and social interactions with outside interests. Students can live with others who share their enthusiasm about specific topics! Although each Themed Living Community has a different focus determined by the group, the goals of Themed Living Communities are to:
<ul>
 	<li>Enhance student’s overall educational experiences;</li>
 	<li>Foster learning through group discussion, activities and reflection;</li>
 	<li>Establish a sense of community;</li>
 	<li>Encourage support and respect of self, community, and world.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Previous Themed Living Communities included:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>No Man's Land</li>
 	<li>Think Tank</li>
 	<li>Cooking And Gaming for Everyone (C.A.G.E.)</li>
 	<li>Green House (Sustainable Living)</li>
 	<li>International Living Community (I.L.C)</li>

 	<li>Pawnee Goddesses (Women’s Leadership)</li>
 	<li>Physically Active Fitness Friends (P.A.F.F.)</li>
 	<li>UMW Dead Poets Society</li>
</ul>
We invite faculty, staff, and students to organize new communities which can be created for students of all majors.  Themed Living Communities are able to apply for housing in any of the upperclass residence halls or apartments (Eagle Landing and UMW Apartments included).  Those participating in Themed Living Communities also receive priority selection, selecting their housing prior to the general UMW population.

<h4><strong>EcoVillage (Location TBD)</strong></h4>
The EcoVillage will consist of passionate students who want to take action to help the environment. Residents in this community believe in raising awareness and encouraging others to care for the world we live in. EcoVillage will be a positive environment for like-minded students to encourage each other to be more environmentally aware and take action for a more sustainable future.  You may express your interest in this community on the Housing and Dining Application in the <a href="https://umw.starrezhousing.com/starrezportal">Housing Portal</a>.
<h4><strong>Eagle Wellness Floor (Location TBD)</strong></h4>
Eagle Wellness Housing is an opportunity for students focused on personal growth to live in a residential community with like-minded neighbors. Residents in this community firmly believe in a model of wellness that maximizes individual potential and supports residents in choosing healthy, responsible lifestyles. Applicants will be expected to adhere to the community expectations in line with this vision, to specifically include refraining from the consumption of alcohol and other controlled substances and the observation of 'courtesy hours' aimed at maintaining an academic environment in the hall.  You may express your interest in this community on the Housing and Dining Application in the <a href="https://umw.starrezhousing.com/starrezportal">Housing Portal</a>.
<h4><strong>International Living Community (Framar House)</strong></h4>
The purpose of the International Living Community (ILC) is to provide the students of the University of Mary Washington with an opportunity to develop and share international interests. The ILC does this in several ways. It provides a system through which individuals are able and are encouraged to explore different cultures and share their findings with other students. It also provides a residential place on campus for those to focus on international interests along with others that have similar interests. One of the goals of the ILC is to educate the campus on worldwide issues. ILC supports the University of Mary Washington’s belief that a broad liberal arts education is the basis of the college learning experience and is the best preparation for a life and career after college. The center is an integral part in spreading global awareness and cultural diversity, which are valued highly by the college.  Students interested in this option must apply for admission into the house through the current ILC Executive Board. <strong> </strong>
<h4><strong>Language Community (South Hall)</strong></h4>
South Hall is the Languages Living and Learning Community, sponsored by the Department of Modern Languages in Literatures. Here language students live together with our visiting language coordinators from China, France, Germany, Italy, Jordan and Spain. With its proximity to Combs Hall, located next to the International Living Community in Framar, South Hall is part of a multilingual and multicultural international environment right here on this beautiful and quiet side of campus.  For more information, feel free to contact MLL Chair Dr. Elizabeth Lewis <a href="mailto:elewis@umw.edu">elewis@umw.edu</a>  or South faculty advisor, Dr. Gonzalo Campos-Dintrans <a href="mailto:gcamposd@umw.edu">gcamposd@umw.edu</a>.  Students interested in this community must apply for admission by going to <a href="https://orgsync.com/127624/forms/352776" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://orgsync.com/127624/forms/352776</a>.  Applications are due February 15, 2018 at 5pm.
