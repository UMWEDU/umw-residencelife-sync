<h2>Association of Residence Halls (ARH)</h2>
The Association of Residence Halls is an organization that promotes social, educational and cultural programming for and by residents. ARH also promotes interaction among the residence halls through Community Councils, develops citizenship through self-governance, and stimulates interest in campus activities and residence hall affairs. Most importantly, ARH strives to leave a lasting legacy of excellence for future residents.

ARH is also the voice of the students living in the residence halls.  ARH works closely with the Office of Residence Life and Housing to promote a great residential experience for students. Suggestions for improvements or changes to residence hall policies are channeled to the Residence Life and Housing through ARH.

All residential students at the University of Mary Washington are members of ARH.  The voting membership includes the elected board and the president of each <strong>Community Council</strong>.

<h2>Community Councils</h2>
Joining Community Council is a great way to get involved in your community and build leadership skills. Each residence hall complex has a Community Council executive board comprised of positions that implement programming for residents of that community. Also, each Community Council sends a minimum of one representative (usually the community council president) to the larger governing body of the Association of Residence Halls (ARH). This representative serves as a liaison between ARH and their complex, bringing your ideas and issues to their attention.

For more information, contact your RA or Area Coordinator.
<h2>Become an RA</h2>
The Resident Assistant (RA) is an experienced UMW student who serves as a member of  Residence Life and Housing staff, caring for and supporting UMW’s residential population. Through their presence and outreach, RAs positively shape the on-campus living experience, while enhancing their own leadership skills (time management, interpersonal communication, budgeting, public speaking, and conflict resolution). Few campus employment opportunities provide students with the scope and depth of this position. Though the RA position requires a significant time commitment, RAs should be prepared for an incredibly rewarding and challenging experience where they can impact the lives of many students.

Resident Assistants serve many roles including: educator, community builder, role model, resource and administrator. They are responsible for fostering student learning and growth, building an inclusive community, forming personal relationships and encouraging residents and staff members to be accountable for their choices and actions. RAs utilize a variety of methods to focus and align their efforts to the over-arching educational priority that students will use critical thinking to make sound decisions. The RA position is a paraprofessional position within the Residence Life and Housing. The RA will have a direct supervisor and will receive indirect supervision from other professional staff within the department. The RA’s main purpose is to develop and maintain an engaging, supportive environment which encourages the pursuit of excellence in support of the mission and vision of the University.

The RA Selection process typically begins in November of each calendar year and decisions are made in early February for the following academic year’s staff.
