<h2>Move-in Day</h2>
We hope you are excited for the big day! We will provide some specific information to ensure the best possible experience for all students and their families arriving on Move-In day. It is important that students and families know in which building the student will be residing. We encourage students to log into the <a href="https://umw.starrezhousing.com/starrezportal">Housing Portal</a> prior to arriving to verify their residence hall and room number.

Please click on the link for your assigned building for a detailed instruction sheet to assist you with your move-in experience. We ask that you do your best to adhere to your assigned move-in time to assist us with traffic flow, particularly in areas where the drop-off zone is small.

Can’t arrive during your move-in time? No worries! We will welcome you when you arrive.
