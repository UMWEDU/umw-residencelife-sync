<h2>Move-in Day</h2>
<span style="color: #ff0000"><em>More information forthcoming as Summer 2018 progresses.</em></span>

We hope you are excited for the big day!  We will provide some specific information to ensure the best possible experience for all students and their families arriving on move-in day.  It is important that students and families know in which building the student will be residing.  We encourage students to log into the Housing Portal prior to coming to verify their residence hall and room number.

Please click on the link for your assigned building for a detailed instruction sheet to assist you with your move-in experience.  We ask that you do your best to adhere to your assigned move-in time to assist us with traffic flow, particularly in areas where the drop-off zone is small.

Can’t arrive during your move-in time?  No worries!  We will welcome you when you arrive.

&nbsp;

<em>Important Announcement Regarding move-in:</em>

Please be mindful that August in Virginia can be hot and humid and sometimes a bit rainy.  Please pack and dress accordingly.  We encourage you to bring water for the whole family and be prepared for some potential wait times as we usher in over 1,000 students each move-in day.

*Don’t forget to label all boxes with last name, first initial, building, and room number
