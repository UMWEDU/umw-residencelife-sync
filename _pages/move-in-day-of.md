<h2>Move-in Day</h2>
We hope you are excited for the big day!  We have provided some specific information to ensure the best possible experience for all students and their families arriving on move-in day.  It is important that students and families know in which building the student will be residing.  We encourage students to log into Symplicity Residence prior to coming to verify their residence hall and room number.

Please click on the link for your assigned building for a detailed instruction sheet to assist you with your move-in experience.  We ask that you do your best to adhere to your assigned move-in time to assist us with traffic flow, particularly in areas where the drop-off zone is small.

Can’t arrive during your move-in time?  No worries!  We will welcome you when you arrive.
