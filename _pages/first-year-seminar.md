<h2>FSEM Communities for First-Year Students</h2>
In Fall 2015, the University of Mary Washington (UMW) designed a first-year seminar program (FSEM) tailored to create “a seamless and coherent first year experience for undergraduates”. The program consists of a year-long experience that boasts increased intentional faculty involvement as well as high expectations for every UMW first-year student.

In addition, first-year students are housed together in their FSEM cohort in order to provide additional opportunities to engage in discussion and learning with their classmates outside the classroom.  RAs will partner with the FSEM faculty and Peer Mentors to offer programming and activities that complement the academic experience.
