<h4>Bunked beds:</h4>
When both beds are placed parallel to each other – one on the bottom and the other above it.  Bed pins secure the bed boards to each other.  Both roommates would have to communicate with each other to determine if this is the best sleeping situation, who would sleep in either bed, etc.  If a specific side of the room is important for the layout of the beds, the students will need to state that information in the work order request.

<h4>Lofted bed:</h4>
When one bed’s boards are doubled and secured with bed pins (and a security bar) to be raised high above the ground. The mattress is placed high so other furniture items are in the space below the mattress to maximize space usage.  The highest a loft can be raised is just under 6 feet, ranging between 5`8 1/2" and 5`9".

<h4 style="clear: both">Bed Adjustments:</h4>
Students wishing to adjust the height of their bed will need to do so themselves using a rubber mallet. Resident Assistants have rubber mallets and can show students the proper way to adjust bed heights.  The beds can be adjusted anywhere from 21" to 33" off the ground.
