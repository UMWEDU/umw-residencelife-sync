<h2>Fall 2015 Early Arrivals</h2>
Students wishing to come to campus early in August will need to obtain approval through the Early Arrival process.  Students sponsored by a University department with a legitimate need to arrive early for a University-sponsored program are not charged for housing; sponsors must submit a request (see below).  Those without a University sponsor may request to arrive early (no earlier than August 17) by submitting an <a href="https://orgsync.com/59554/forms/146282">Individual Early Arrival Request Form</a> at least 48 hours prior to requesting to arrive (forms not able to be submitted past noon on August 21); there is a $30 per day fee for those approved, and without the dining plan in effect, any meals must be purchased by the student as needed.

Key pick-up location is variable based on date/time arriving. Review <a href="/residencelife/move-in/">move-in information</a> for details.
<h3>Requests for Sponsored Early Arriving Students Due 7/16/2015</h3>
August move-in information for University on-campus residences may be viewed at <a href="/residencelife/move-in">the move-in page</a>. Below is information for sponsors wishing to bring residential students back to campus early.  Students typically expect services and offices to be up-and-running even though the campus community is bustling with training, orientations, preparing for the new semester, and other opening activities, in addition to everyday operations.

There is no charge for early arrival housing if a student is sponsored by a University department for a valid reason. <strong>It is very important, therefore, that you sponsor only the students you need to arrive early.</strong> Campus employees should not grant permission to students who call or e-mail asking to come back early – there should be a <em>real need</em> for the early arrival. Students sponsored to come to campus early should be granted early access approval because it is vital to fulfill a purpose, to provide a service, or to be a part of a program. With the ending of summer conferences, the transition from summer campus housing, and the early arrival of students, Facilities Services and many others have a great deal of to accomplish to adequately prepare the campus residences.

Sponsors must e-mail their <a href="http://www.umw.edu/residencelife/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2016/01/EarlyArrivalSpreadsheet.xlsx">Early Arrival Spreadsheet</a> to Residence Life staff at <a href="mailto:reslife@umw.edu">reslife@umw.edu</a> no later than <strong>Thursday, July 16</strong>. To complete the spreadsheet, each sponsor will need to know the information below for each <em>residential</em> student arriving early to campus.
<ul>
	<li>Student’s Banner ID number</li>
	<li>Student’s name</li>
	<li>Student’s arrival date (the date getting key and settling-in)</li>
	<li>Sponsor’s name, e-mail address, office phone number, and emergency contact phone number</li>
</ul>
<strong>Early arrivals will not be permitted on campus before Friday, August 14.</strong> The date the sponsor should indicate their students should arrive needs to allow for unloading and unpacking of belongings (typically, one day earlier than the start date of the program or activity).
<h3>Meals</h3>
Residence Life will not coordinate meal needs. Sponsors paying for early arrival meals in the dining hall until the meal plan begins must <a href="http://www.umwdining.com">coordinate a catering contract</a> with Sodexo’s Leslie Jacobs to cover any student dining needs. A detailed list of the students being sponsored would then need to be emailed to Leslie Jacobs and Patty Land for EagleOne card programming. All sponsors should make it clear to students whether meals will be provided to them in order to manage expectations upfront.
<h3>Moving In</h3>
Residence Life staff will email students approved to move in early regarding when they can move in, how to get their keys, and behavioral expectations. Sponsors must communicate information such as if they are providing meals, additional expectations, and any other logistical information. Students arriving early to campus will need to check-in at the Eagle Landing desk between 9:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m., with the following exceptions:

<em>Wednesday, August 19</em> from 9:00am – 11:00am at residence hall complex (if arriving afterwards, noon at Eagle Landing)
<em>Thursday, August 20</em> from 8:00am – 11:30am at residence hall complex (if arriving afterwards, 12:30pm at Eagle Landing)
