<h2>Fall Semester Early Arrivals</h2>
Students wishing to come to campus early in August will need to obtain approval through the Early Arrival process. <em>Due to the changes on campus, we will do our best to have Early Arrivals move into their Fall assignments, however students may be housed in temporary locations based on the readiness of the residence halls.</em>

Early Arrival Options:
<ul>
 	<li>Sponsored Group</li>
 	<li>Individual Request (upperclassmen only)</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Sponsored Group</strong></h3>
Students sponsored by a University department with a legitimate need to arrive early for a University-sponsored program are not charged for housing; sponsors must submit a request via email using the <a href="http://www.umw.edu/residencelife/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2016/01/EarlyArrivalSpreadsheet.xlsx">Early Arrival Spreadsheet</a> template to <a href="mailto:reslife@umw.edu">reslife@umw.edu</a>.

The deadline to sponsor early arrivals is<strong> Friday, August 10, 2018</strong>

To complete the spreadsheet, each sponsor will need to know the information below for each <em>residential</em> student arriving early to campus.
<ul>
 	<li>Student’s Banner ID number</li>
 	<li>Student’s full legal name</li>
 	<li>Student’s arrival date (the date getting key and settling-in)</li>
 	<li>Sponsor’s name, e-mail address, office phone number, and emergency contact phone number</li>
</ul>
<h3>Individual Requests (Upperclassmen only)</h3>
Those upperclassmen without a University sponsor may request to arrive early (no earlier than August 23) by submitting an <a href="https://umw.starrezhousing.com/starrezportal">Individual Early Arrival Request Form</a> via the Housing portal no later than Sunday, August 19<sup>th</sup> at 11:50 p.m.; there is a $30 per day fee for those approved, and without the dining plan in effect, any meals must be purchased by the student as needed. Fall meal plans start with dinner on Saturday, August 25<sup>th</sup>, 2018. Approval will be made based on the readiness of the residence halls to receive students.

<b><i>Please note: approval of sponsored Early Arrivals is not guaranteed.</i></b>

Key pick-up location for all upperclassman early arrivals is Eagle Landing Front Desk between the hours of 8 a.m. and 10 p.m.
