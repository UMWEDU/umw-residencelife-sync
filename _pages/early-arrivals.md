<h2>Fall Semester Early Arrivals</h2>
Students wishing to come to campus early in August will need to obtain approval through the Early Arrival process.  Early Arrival Options:
<ul>
 	<li>Sponsored Group</li>
 	<li>Individual Request (upperclassmen only)</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Sponsored Group</strong></h3>
Students sponsored by a University department with a legitimate need to arrive early for a University-sponsored program are not charged for housing; sponsors must submit a request via email using the <a href="http://www.umw.edu/residencelife/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2016/01/EarlyArrivalSpreadsheet.xlsx">Early Arrival Spreadsheet</a> template to <a href="mailto:reslife@umw.edu">reslife@umw.edu</a>.

The deadline to sponsor early arrivals is<strong> Friday, August 4, 2017</strong>

To complete the spreadsheet, each sponsor will need to know the information below for each <em>residential</em> student arriving early to campus.
<ul>
 	<li>Student’s Banner ID number</li>
 	<li>Student’s full legal name</li>
 	<li>Student’s arrival date (the date getting key and settling-in)</li>
 	<li>Sponsor’s name, e-mail address, office phone number, and emergency contact phone number</li>
</ul>
<em><strong>Early</strong> <strong>arrivals will not be permitted on campus before Sunday, August 13.  </strong></em>The date the sponsor should indicate their students should arrive needs to allow for unloading and unpacking of belongings (typically, one day earlier than the start date of the program or activity).
<h3>Individual Requests (Upperclassmen only)</h3>
Those upperclassmen without a University sponsor may request to arrive early (no earlier than August 24) by submitting an <a href="https://orgsync.com/59554/forms/146282">Individual Early Arrival Request Form</a> no later than Sunday, August 20<sup>th</sup> at 11:50 p.m.; there is a $30 per day fee for those approved, and without the dining plan in effect, any meals must be purchased by the student as needed. Fall meal plans start with dinner on Saturday, August 26<sup>th</sup>, 2017.

Key pick-up location for all upperclassman early arrivals is Eagle Landing Front Desk between the hours of 8 a.m. and 10 p.m.
