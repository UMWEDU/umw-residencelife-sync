<h3>Available Meal Plans</h3>
View detailed information on the <a href="https://umw.sodexomyway.com/dining-plans/index.html">available meal plans</a>.
<h3>Commuter Students</h3>
Commuter students may select a meal plan by submitting a Commuter Meal Plan Agreement application.  To select a meal plan log in and access the application through <a href="https://umw.starrezhousing.com/StarRezPortal/F8B0E82A/1/1/Home-Home">the Housing Portal</a>.  If the application is not available after logging in, email <a href="mailto:reslife@umw.edu">reslife@umw.edu</a> to request access.
<h3>Residential Students</h3>
All residential students must have a meal plan.  Residential students select their meal plan through the Housing and Dining Services Agreement application process in the Housing Portal.  Residential students wishing to be exempt from having a meal plan may submit the <a href="https://orgsync.com/59554/forms/82435">Meal Plan Exemption Request Form</a>.
<h3>Changes to Meal Plans</h3>
All changes in meal plans, meaning increases or decreases, must be requested within the first two weeks of classes each semester.  Any requests submitted after the second week of classes will be automatically denied unless the student moved from Eagle Landing or the UMW Apartments into a traditional residence hall.  In such cases the student will be assigned the smallest meal plan for traditional housing, unless otherwise indicated.  <strong>Note</strong>:  First time students on the Eagle Plan are not allowed to change their meal plan during the first academic year regardless of where they live.

If a student finds themselves without meals before the semester has concluded, the student needs to add money on their EagleOne to use for dining purposes.  Residence Life is not able to raise a meal plan, or add meals/flex dollars, after the first two weeks of each semester.
<h4>Meal Plan Change Instructions:</h4>
Log in and access the Meal Plan Change application through <a href="https://umw.starrezhousing.com/StarRezPortal/F8B0E82A/1/1/Home-Home">the Housing Portal</a>.

<strong>Commuter Meal Plan Cancellation</strong>

Commuter meal plans are selected for both Fall and Spring semesters.  If a commuter student decides he/she wants to cancel or change the meal plan for the Spring semester, he/she must complete the Meal Plan Change application (this includes if he/she decides to not take classes during the Spring semester).
