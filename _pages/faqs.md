All residential students have questions about living on campus; you are not alone! Check out the answers below - and find the best way to ask your question if it's not included here.
<h2>Housing</h2>
<strong>What should I bring – and <em>not</em> bring – to campus?
</strong>Residence Life has put together a <a href="http://www.umw.edu/residencelife/before-you-get-to-campus/move-in/what-to-bring/">list to assist you with packing decisions</a>.

<strong>I’m looking to change rooms.  I don’t like the building assignment I received, and I don’t think I will get along with my assigned roommate.  What can I do?
</strong>Keep an open mind.  More times than not, students have a completely different experience than their worst fear and end up being very satisfied with their living arrangements.  Give it a shot upon moving in.  Once you have given it your all, if you continue to have reservations, talk with your Resident Assistant.  Read the Changes to Housing Assignments information.  Note: with very little space available for room changes, you are unlikely to be reassigned until you have followed through with the process.

<strong>What are the bathroom facilities like?
</strong>Some residence halls have communal hall bathrooms where each floor shares a common area bathroom containing individual toilets and shower stalls cleaned by the housekeeping staff. Other residence halls have suite-style bathrooms with two rooms connected by a shared bathroom cleaned by the residents of the adjoining rooms. Both styles have their own unique advantages.  All upperclass buildings have suite-style bathrooms.
<h2>Residential Experience</h2>
<strong>I don’t have a roommate. Will I be assigned one?
</strong>Yes, most likely you will receive a roommate. We have a number of outstanding assignments, including students on waiting lists and incoming students who have not yet submitted a Housing application. Please keep checking back to see if you’ve been assigned a roommate.

<strong>I don’t think my roommate and I are going to get along. How can I change rooms?
</strong>We strongly encourage you to make an effort to get to know your roommate. You may find that you have more in common than you expected. However, should the need to change rooms arise, you should speak with your RA to get the process started after the first week of classes.

<strong>What are Resident Assistants and how can they help me?
</strong>Resident Assistants are specially trained upperclass residents who live in the building and assist each resident in their adjustment to University life. RAs provide everything from work orders and maintenance requests to social and educational programming. They are available to answer any question a resident might have about life here at the University. They also serve as a resource for valuable information about campus activities and awareness.

<strong>Can I have overnight visitors in the residence halls?
</strong>First-year students are not allowed to have overnight visitors the first semester of their freshman year. This regulation is reviewed in the spring semester and residents of each building will vote on whether to allow visitation second semester as part of the community standards.
<h2>Facilities</h2>
<strong>What is included in my room?
</strong>Each residence hall is unique, but some standard furnishings include an XL twin bed frame and mattress, desk, and chair for each resident. Each resident also has dresser and closet space. Cable and internet services are also provided. You will need to provide your own television, coaxial cable, computer, and ethernet cable.

<strong>Do I need to bring my own computer?
</strong>Computers are not required; however, they are strongly recommended. There are several 24-hour computer labs on campus where students can do research, and type documents and have them printed. For technology-related information, visit <a href="https://technology.umw.edu/new/students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://technology.umw.edu/new/students/</a>.

<strong>Can I get a fridge for my room?
</strong>Students are permitted to have no more than one fridge in doubles and triples and no more than two fridges in quads. The fridges can be no more than 4.5 cubic feet in size and pull no more than two amps. Individuals in UMW Apartments and Eagle Landing are not permitted to have mini-fridges in their rooms.

<strong>Where can I get a carpet for my room?
</strong>Various retailers have area rugs available. We recommend that you work with your roommate(s) to determine if a carpet is desired and who will be responsible for purchasing it.

<strong>What size sheets should I buy?
</strong>All resident rooms have extra-long mattresses. It is best to buy XL twin sheets or twin sheets with “expanded” or “deep” pockets.  XL twin sheets can be hard to find, especially during the beginning of the school year. The <a href="https://umw.bncollege.com/shop/umw/home">UMW Bookstore</a> offers linens, and other organizational and decorative items to help you tailor your room to fit your style.

<strong>Should I bring all of my belongings at once?
</strong>Before making a decision, we encourage you to contact your roommate to discuss who will bring the television, carpet, mini-fridge, etc. Making contact with your roommate before arriving can make for a smooth transition to University life. After all, you will be living together for nine months, sharing experiences and space.  You should also take into consideration how far away your family lives and how easy it will be for you to bring extra items to campus throughout the year.

<strong>Can I have a pet in my room?
</strong>The only pet permitted in the residence halls is underwater fish in only one tank no larger than 10 gallons (one per room).  Residents found in violation will be fined $150 and given 48 hours to remove the animal from the premises. If the animal is not removed, we have no option but to turn it over to Animal Control, refer the incident to the Office of Student Conduct and Responsibility, and add a fine of $50 per day.

<strong>Do all of the residence halls have elevators?
</strong>Not all residence halls have elevators.  The residence halls with elevators are Alvey, Arrington, Jefferson, Marshall, Mason, and Randolph.

<strong>Is there a housekeeping service to clean my room and bathroom?
</strong>There is no housekeeping service to clean individual residence hall rooms or suite-style bathrooms. Housekeeping staff clean hall bathrooms that are shared by an entire floor.

<strong>Is smoking permitted in the residence halls?
</strong>All residence halls are non-smoking. Additionally, while smoking is allowed outside of the residence halls, students are required to be <strong>50 feet</strong> from the building.

<strong>Can I have a lofted or bunked bed?
</strong>You may not bring in outside lofts.  The University beds are able to be bunked or lofted for your convenience. Please visit <a href="http://www.umw.edu/residencelife/on-campus/housing-procedures/configuring-your-bed/">Configuring Your Bed</a> for more information about lofts, bunks, and how to request a lofting/bunking kit.
