The University of Mary Washington believes that living on campus is an integral part of a student’s complete educational experience; therefore, <strong>all full-time students who are admitted as residential students in their first year are required to live on campus for two full academic years</strong>.

Exceptions may be made for students who:
<ul>
	<li>are married</li>
	<li>are 23 years of age or older before the first day of the fall semester</li>
	<li>have dependent children living with them</li>
	<li>are living with a parent, grandparent, or guardian within 30 miles of the University of Mary Washington</li>
	<li>have a college-endorsed internship or clinical placement, or are student teaching outside the Fredericksburg area (approved by UMW Academic Affairs)</li>
</ul>
To be granted an exception for reasons other than those listed, the applicant must be very specific and extensive in his or her explanation of the significant, uncontrollable, and unforeseen extenuating circumstances. Medical requests to be released from the on-campus obligation must go through the Housing Accommodations process in the Office of Disability Resources.

In order to be approved to live off campus, prospective students must consult with admissions staff.  Students already on campus must follow the procedures in the <a href="http://www.umw.edu/residencelife/on-campus/housing-procedures/current-students-termination-of-housing-agreement/">Termination of Housing Agreement</a>.
