Students have 5 business days from the date of notification of residence hall charges to appeal. Appeal procedures are detailed below.
<h2>How to appeal a residence life charge:</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Review the email from Residence Life that contains information about the charge(s) assessed.</li>
	<li>Review the explanation of <a href="http://www.umw.edu/residencelife/on-campus/charges/damage-detail-codes/">Damage Detail Codes</a>.</li>
	<li>Review the criteria for appeal:
<ol>
	<li>You believe that the charge was assessed in error (i.e. the damage was noted on your Room Condition Inventory at the time of move-in)</li>
	<li>You have information to verify that the damage was caused by someone else (i.e. a signed note from another UMW student taking responsibility for the damage)</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Submit the appeal below.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Important Notes:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All appeal requests must be submitted by the UMW student assessed the charge</li>
	<li>Residence Life staff cannot discuss charges or appeal requests with anyone other than the student without the student’s written consent.</li>
	<li>Charges are added to the student’s account after the deadline for appeal has passed.</li>
	<li>Once an appeal request is submitted, a decision will be communicated via e-mail within ten business days.</li>
	<li>Because it is a busy time for Residence Life staff, it is more efficient to avoid calling and emailing about damage charges.</li>
</ol>
