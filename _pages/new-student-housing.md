The University of Mary Washington believes that living on campus is an integral part of a student’s complete educational experience; therefore, all full-time students who are admitted as residential students in their first year are <a href="http://www.umw.edu/residencelife/before-you-get-to-campus/new-student-housing/on-campus-living-requirement/">required to live on campus</a> for two full academic years. Transfer students admitted in the fall as residential students are required to live on campus for two semesters, and transfer students admitted in the spring as residential students are required to live on campus for one semester.

Exceptions may be made for students who:
<ul>
	<li>are married</li>
	<li>are 23 years of age or older before the first day of the fall semester.</li>
	<li>have dependent children living with them</li>
	<li>are living with a parent, grandparent or guardian within 30 miles of the University of Mary Washington</li>
</ul>
In order to be approved to live off campus, prospective students must consult with admissions staff.
<h2>First Year Student Housing Information</h2>
First-year (new “freshmen”) students will be housed in Living Learning Communities (LLCs), which are clustered within the residence halls, based on the First Year Seminar (FSEM) course in which they are enrolled.  The positive effect of learning communities on students’ academic success is well documented with significant gains observed in academic performance.  Students who live together and share meaningful academic experiences form friendships and boost out-of-the-classroom learning.  Because of this substantial benefit, first-year students will live with or in close proximity to their LLC in the residence halls.

<strong>After accepting UMW’s offer of admission and paying their deposit, incoming first-year students will be emailed (beginning in late February) a link to the</strong><strong> </strong><em><strong><u>First-Year Student Questionnaire</u></strong></em><strong>, an online survey which helps staff identify their FSEM preferences. </strong><strong> </strong>UMW will work to match students to seminars of their choice.  Each of the FSEM courses is associated with a residence hall.  Therefore, when students are placed in an FSEM, they will be assigned to a residential community. Students may indicate a preferred roommate(s).  On the First Year Student Questionnaire, students may indicate a preference for a roommate, and UMW will do its best to make matches accordingly.  To ensure preferred roommates are assigned together, both students should must indicate the other as their preferred roommate on both the first semester questionnaire and on the housing application.  Both students should also submit the same rankings of FSEM courses so both students are in the same class and can easily be housed together in the LLC.

Some circumstances will necessitate an assignment outside of the Living Learning Community. The following are examples:
<ul>
	<li>students approved for housing accommodations (efforts will be made to provide approved accommodations within the LLC when possible)</li>
	<li>students with requests for roommates not in the same FSEM</li>
	<li>students desiring gender-neutral housing</li>
	<li>female students desiring an all-female residence hall</li>
</ul>
<h2>Transfer Students Housing Information</h2>
Transfer students may rank their building preferences on their housing applications.  All buildings (first-year communities and upper-class buildings) are included in the preference ranking options.  Assignments will be made based on space availability.

Note: Transfer students with fewer than 30 credits wishing to participate in the First Year Experience, which includes taking an FSEM course and living in a first year community, should speak with a Student Success Coordinator in Academic and Career Services.

<h2>Housing Assignment Communication</h2>
<strong>First year students</strong> will initially know the building, but not the exact room number, to which they are assigned based on the FSEM they select. Students will be emailed their room number, roommate information, etc. at the end of May.  Students submitting housing applications after this date will be assigned housing on a rolling basis.  <em><strong>Note that Residence Life staff will email notices only to UMW accounts.</strong></em>

<strong>Transfer students</strong> will be assigned housing on a rolling basis.  Students will be emailed their room number, roommate information, etc. at the end of May. Students submitting housing applications after mid-May will be assigned and communicated on a rolling basis.  <em><strong>Note that Residence Life staff will send email notices only to UMW accounts.</strong></em>
