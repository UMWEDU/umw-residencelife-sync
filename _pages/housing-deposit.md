Every residential student must pay a housing deposit in the amount of $250 either at the time of admission or upon returning to university housing. <strong>Students may not complete a housing application until a housing deposit is paid and processed.</strong>

The deposit is held until the student departs campus housing. If there are no damages or other charges assessed on the student’s account at that time, the Office of Student Accounts will later process a refund. Students who are approved to be released from their housing and dining services agreement forfeit their housing deposit.

Newly admitted residential students must pay their housing deposit through the <a href="http://www.umw.edu/admissions/">Office of Admissions</a>.

All other students requesting to live in University housing must pay their deposit directly to the Office of Residence Life with a $250 <strong>check or money order</strong> (credit card and EagleOne payments not accepted). It should be made out to UMW with the student’s Banner ID number (beginning with “000”) in the memo line, and brought to Marye House or mailed to:

UMW Residence Life
Attn: Michelle Brooks
1301 College Avenue
Fredericksburg, VA 22401

To pay a housing deposit in cash,email <a href="mailto:mesch@umw.edu">mesch@umw.edu</a> to make arrangements to bring exact change to Marye House.
