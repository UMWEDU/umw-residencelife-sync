Students that are leaving UMW for any reason, at any time, will be asked to fill out an Intent to Vacate form available through MyUMW forms. Reasons for leaving UMW include withdraw, suspension, leave of absence, transfer, study abroad, graduation, marriage, or approved change to part time status.

Students need to complete this form prior to leaving the UMW campus as departure procedures must be taken by the student as issued in an email from Residence Life. Students that are leaving at the completion of the current semester for the following semester, must fill out the form prior to leaving campus.

Once the completed form has been submitted, a staff member of Residence Life will send the student an email with the steps that must be taken before leaving campus. This email details the importance of avoiding fines by cleaning the space that is being vacated, instructions on turning in keys, and more.

Students that are leaving campus for a reason not listed on the Intent to Vacate University Housing form must detail what reason they are leaving campus; if a meeting with the Director is required, the student has the chance to note the meeting date.

Students that are leaving campus due to an approved change to part time status must have been given permission by Chris Porter, Director of Residence Life and Commuter Student Services.
