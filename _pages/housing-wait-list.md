<strong>Following the housing selection process each spring we have a small percentage of individuals who have a housing assignment but would prefer a different assignment.  These individuals may choose to put their name on the Housing Wait List.  </strong>

Over the summer Residence Life staff members work to reassign students into their preferred housing assignment.  Given limited availability of spaces following housing selection this is not always possible.

Do not submit the Housing Wait List form if:
<ul>
	<li>You are experiencing roommate concerns. Instead, follow the <a href="http://www.umw.edu/residencelife/on-campus/housing-procedures/changes/">Changes to Housing Assignments</a> process.</li>
	<li>You are a Commuter Students who has decided you would like to live on campus in the fall. Instead, contact Brittany Harper at <a href="mailto:bharper2@umw.edu">bharper2@umw.edu</a>.</li>
</ul>
