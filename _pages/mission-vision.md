<h2>Mission</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the University of Mary Washington, the mission of Residence Life and Housing is to build and sustain a developmentally-based, socially just, and research-informed program that will encourage studentsâ€™ growth and development, build interpersonal relationships, and integrate student learning opportunities across their college experience.</span></p>

<h2>Vision</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By reimagining and renovating residence halls and apartments and incorporating learning opportunities into on-campus living, UMW will combine new collaborative and digital spaces with the historical essence and beauty of our campus. In so doing, we will enhance our liberal arts and sciences mission and encourage connections to UMW that will last a lifetime.</span></p>
