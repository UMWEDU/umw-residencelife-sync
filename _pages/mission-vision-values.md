<h2>Mission</h2>
Residence Life and Housing (RLH) enhances the recruitment, retention, and success of UMW students by providing:
<ul>
 	<li>A variety of living options to meet individual student needs;</li>
 	<li>Opportunities for students to meet and engage with one another and for the university community to foster a sense of belonging;</li>
 	<li>Support as each studentÂ is challenged to develop a personal sense of responsibility to self, others, and society.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Vision</h2>
RLH believes in the development of the whole student and is committed to making UMW home regardless of where one lives.
