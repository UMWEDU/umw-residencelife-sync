<h2>March 23, 2020</h2>
Dear residential students and families,

We have been closely monitoring the ongoing developments of the COVID-19 crisis.  Based on the continued spread of the virus in Virginia and recommendations to stay home, we are postponing the retrieval of belongings until later in April.  Another communication will be sent on April 6 with further updates and procedures for signing up to retrieve your belongings.  We ask for your cooperation by not returning to campus until the belonging retrieval process resumes in mid to late April.

Students who are living on campus and have not been approved through last week’s petition process to remain should continue to make arrangements to move out.  Only those students that have been granted permission should be residing in the residence halls at this time.

Staff from residence life and housing, facilities, and public safety will be conducting walk-throughs this week to ensure that unoccupied rooms are locked and secure.  Access to the residence halls will be restricted to only those individuals approved to remain as well as university personnel.  Public safety will continue 24/7 monitoring of our campus.

To read the rest of this message and for more information about UMW and the response to COVID-19/coronavirus, please see the <a href="https://www.umw.edu/advisories/coronavirus/">Campus Advisories</a> page.

<h2>Update about Census 2020</h2>
Census Day is approaching!  Despite the impact of COVID-19, the US Census Bureau is continuing its efforts to count everyone.  There are likely questions about where students need to be counted now that many of them have returned home.  According to census2020.gov, all residential students should still be counted at their institution of higher education.

Residence Life and Housing is prepared to do much of the work, but Virginia law requires that each residential student opt-in before we can release any information to the U.S. Census Bureau.  With your help, everyone can be counted!  If you haven’t done so, please complete the following form that only asks three questions: <a href="https://umw.presence.io/form/census-2020">https://umw.presence.io/form/census-2020</a>

The form includes what information will be sent as part of Census 2020.  Remember, the U.S. Census Bureau cannot share your personal information with any other government agency.
