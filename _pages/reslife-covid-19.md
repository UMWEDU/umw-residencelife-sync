<p class="xxmsonormal">Dear UMW students:</p>
<p class="xxmsonormal">As President Troy Paino described in his message to the Mary Washington community, the Emergency Operations Team has been working diligently to respond to COVID-19. There are no confirmed cases on our campuses, but in the last few days, several cases have been confirmed in Virginia. Therefore, UMW has decided to move students to online and alternate learning from Monday March 16 through Friday April 3. This move will minimize the risks to our community’s safety and wellbeing, which is our paramount priority.</p>
<p class="xxmsonormal">The University will continue to communicate with you all the while.</p>
<p class="xxmsonormal"><b>What does this mean for the student experience?</b></p>
<p class="xxmsonormal">·         <b>Campus operations</b>. The University will remain open with most operations and services continuing with minimal interruptions. This includes the Talley Center and the Student Health Center. Within the next day, we will update the updated <a href="https://www.umw.edu/advisories/coronavirus/">FAQs</a> with information about buildings’ hours and operations, including the fitness center.</p>
<p class="xxmsonormal">·         <b>Residential students</b>. Residential students are strongly encouraged to go home. The health risks of this virus are great, and we need your help in responding to them by following the strategy of social distancing, recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and other health safety experts. Please take with you crucial belongings, including books and computers, that will be needed to continue your classes and learning remotely.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><span style="color: #ff0000">We understand that some students cannot return home for a variety of reasons; they should fill out this <a style="color: #ff0000" href="https://umw.presence.io/form/register-to-remain-on-campus">form</a> with their information to allow Residence Life and Housing to make appropriate accommodations. Please make every effort to complete this by Friday March 13 at Noon.</span></p>
<p class="xxmsonormal">·         <b>Dining. </b>Regular dining services will continue through this Sunday March 15. In the spirit of precaution, UMW Dining Services will implement several temporary food-service measures, such as eliminating all self-service stations and providing single-use utensils. Please find details about Dining Services’ altered operating procedures <a href="https://content-service.sodexomyway.com/media/COVID_tcm165-101487.pdf?url=https://umw.sodexomyway.com/">online</a>.

<p class="xxmsonormal">·         <b>On-Campus Student Employment</b>. By the end of the day tomorrow, we will update the <a href="https://www.umw.edu/advisories/coronavirus/">FAQs</a> about student employment.</p>
Your education matters deeply to us; indeed, it gives us great purpose. As President Paino stated in his message, we are absolutely committed to keeping students on track to complete their coursework for the semester and maintain progress towards graduation. You, our students, are the beacon that guides in support of UMW’s mission.

And finally, in support of <a title="https://www.umw.edu/about/our-principles-and-values/" href="https://www.umw.edu/about/our-principles-and-values/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASPIRE</a> and in honor of Dr. James Farmer’s legacy, never forget that UMW is committed to creating an environment that supports the wellbeing, dignity, and safety of all students, faculty, and staff.
