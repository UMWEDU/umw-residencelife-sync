<p class="xmsonormal"><span style="color: #000000">We understand that some students cannot return home for a variety of reasons due to the University moving to online classes because of COVID-19 or coronavirus. Students remaining on campus should fill out this <span style="color: #ff0000"><a style="color: #ff0000" href="https://umw.presence.io/form/register-to-remain-on-campus">form</a></span>Â with their information to allow Residence Life and Housing to make appropriate accommodations. Please make every effort to complete this by Friday March 13 at Noon.</span></p>
