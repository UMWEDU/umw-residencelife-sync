The Housing and Dining Services Agreement is a legally binding agreement between the student and the University.  Release from this agreement is rarely granted.

To review the termination/cancellation criteria, review the <a href="http://students.umw.edu/residencelife/agreementinfo/">terms and conditions</a> of the Housing and Dining Services Agreement.
<h3>If you believe that you meet one of the criteria listed submit the <a href="https://orgsync.com/59554/forms/290984">Petition for Release</a> from Housing and Dining Services Agreement form.</h3>
The timeline for reviewing petitions is typically within 10 business days.  Occasionally, a petition may take more time for review and to make a determination.  If you chose to meet with the Office of Residence Life and Housing regarding your petition, you will typically receive a meeting invitation within 2 business days.  After the meeting, a determination will be made and delivered via UMW e-mail within the remaining 8 business days which resume after the meeting is concluded.  If you do not need to meet regarding your petition, a determination will be made and delivered within the original 10 business days.
