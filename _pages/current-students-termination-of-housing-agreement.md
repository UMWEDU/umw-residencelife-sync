The Housing and Dining Services Agreement is a legally binding agreement between the student and the University.  Release from this agreement is rarely granted.

To review the termination/cancellation criteria, review the <a href="http://students.umw.edu/residencelife/agreementinfo/">terms and conditions</a> of the Housing and Dining Services Agreement.
<h3>If you believe that you meet one of the criteria listed submit the <a href="https://umw.starrezhousing.com/starrezportal">Petition for Release</a> from Housing and Dining Services Agreement form.</h3>
Petitions are reviewed by committee on the first Tuesday of every month.  This is an administrative process, so all explanations and supporting documentation must be included in the written petition. Decisions of the committee are FINAL.

Questions about the Petition process may be directed to <a href="mailto:reslife@umw.edu">reslife@umw.edu</a>
