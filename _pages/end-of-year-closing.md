<h4><a href="http://students.umw.edu/residencelife/extendedhousing">May Extended Stay Housing</a></h4>
<h4>24-Hour Quiet Hours</h4>
As the Spring semester winds down, there is one final push to complete final exams, projects, and papers.  All residential buildings follow 24-hour quiet hours from 12:01 a.m. Saturday, April 23 until Saturday, May 1.  Quiet hours are meant to provide a noise-free atmosphere so all spaces on campus can be academically-focused.  Students are asked to be considerate of their neighbors during this time by not being heard outside their rooms.  As students finish final exams and papers and prepare to move-out, they are asked to be aware that others are still in the process. Students who are disruptive to the community may be asked to leave and/or fined.
<h4>How to Clean Your Living Space</h4>
There are no on-campus storage options.  All residences are used over the summer by summer conference groups or for summer students.  <strong>Items may not be left in residences.</strong>  Students should not place belongings or trash in the hallway.  Items left in the hallway will be charged to the community if responsibility cannot be determined.  Recycling should be secured in bags and placed in the recycling Toters adjacent to the building.  Trash should be placed in <strong><em>outside dumpsters</em></strong>.  When moving out, students should not leave anything in the hallway unattended as it may be considered abandoned and be taken. Students must clean their living space as follows:
<ul>
 	<li>Carefully remove all tape, stickers, adhesive tape, etc. from walls, doors, ceilings, mirrors, and windows.</li>
 	<li>Clean off writing on doors, walls, desks, dressers, or chairs. Wash all furniture surfaces – chairs, desks, dressers, window sills etc. There should be no stains, black smudges, tape, or sticky spots left.</li>
 	<li>Place all furniture in the room, in its original place and condition. Bunked or lofted beds may remain (Facilities staff will later attend to them).</li>
 	<li>Bring all of your trash and recycling to the appropriate containers outside the building.  Do not sweep garbage into the hallway. Each resident will be billed for garbage/recycling or items left in the hallway, bathroom, or other common spaces.</li>
 	<li>Remove <strong><u>all</u></strong> personal belongings.</li>
 	<li>Sweep and mop entire room floor, if not carpeted. No dust bunnies or dirt should be left behind or under furniture.</li>
 	<li>Empty all drawers and wipe out all dust.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Donate Items to Goodwill at the <em>Drop ‘N Go</em></h4>
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">UMW has partnered with Goodwill Industries International, Inc., and donation drop-off locations will be available on campus.  Students are encouraged to donate gently used unwanted items.  It is sustainable for the environment by avoiding landfills, and it helps those looking for that special item.</span>
<h4>Handling Trash</h4>
There will be additional thirty yard waste containers (dumpsters) spread throughout campus for move-out use by April 25. Students should place large bulky items such as furniture and carpets in these containers.  Household type trash should be placed in the regular eight yard front-end containers located near every campus building. Students should recycle as much as possible.
<h4>Eagle Landing Trash</h4>
There will be two regular dumpsters at the rear of Eagle Landing for overflow trash and recycling.  Any bulky items or carpets at Eagle Landing should be placed next to the dumpsters.  <span class="s1">Trash chutes will be closed for the duration of move out. Students will need to take their trash to one of the dumpsters in back of the building.</span>
<h4>Mailbox Information</h4>
All students graduating, studying abroad, transferring, or withdrawing will need to submit a completed UMW forwarding form to campus mail services, as well as notify all correspondents their address has changed. Students should stop by the UMW Post Office in the Woodard Campus Center to submit a completed forwarding form.  These forms are available at the UMW Post Office and the Eagle Landing front desk.  Students staying on campus during the entire summer should not forward their mail.
<h2>Moving Out Tips</h2>
If you have friends or family assisting you with moving out, please share with them this helpful information.
<ul>
 	<li>Bring some muscle and a hand truck.  The move-in crew that may have assisted to move in will not be present to help move out (since student departures are staggered depending on final exams, etc.).</li>
 	<li>Wear comfortable clothes.</li>
 	<li>Keep hydrated.</li>
 	<li>Follow all parking policies (see below).  If parking in a temporary loading zone, move your vehicle as soon as possible so others can load their vehicles.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Parking Information</h3>
In preparation for residential student move out, Parking Management would like to work with students to complete a safe and efficient departure. Please see your Resident Assistant, or visit Parking Management in Lee Hall 201B to pick up a temporary parking pass to assist you with loading and departure if needed. Those needing passes may include, but are not limited to the following:

*Students with different decal designation needing added privilege or using unregistered vehicle for move out need a Temporary Dash Pass for the area needed. This can be obtained by the student from their Resident Assistant or from Parking Management. It will include a time limit for Faculty/Staff lots. The UMW Police Department will handle after hours Temporary Pass requests, if needed.

*Parents or others helping a student to move out with unregistered vehicles needing access to any space other than Visitor need a Temporary Dash Pass for the area needed. This can be obtained from Parking Management in Lee Hall. The student can also obtain one in advance from their RA if the exact time of arrival is known. It will include a time limit for Faculty/Staff lots. The UMW Police Department will handle after hours Temporary Pass requests, if needed.

Vehicles will not be allowed to drive on walkways, park on the grass, in Fire Lanes, Reserved, or Handicap spaces, etc. to load vehicles. However, Parking Management will provide temporary parking passes for lots located nearest the residence hall; cars without appropriate passes, or parked illegally will be ticketed.
<h4>Eagle Landing Parking RFIDs</h4>
Students living in Eagle Landing with an RFID parking pass, which opens the parking deck gate, must turn in their RFID to the Eagle Landing front desk between the desk hours of 8 a.m. and 10 p.m. and immediately before leaving campus. Students who will returning to Eagle Landing next year must return their RFID; a new RFID will be issued in the Fall. Students not returning RFIDs will be charged $50.
<h4><strong>Security</strong></h4>
Students should remember to keep their doors locked at all times. When packing and moving out, they should not leave their room or belongings unattended. There will be many people on campus during the last few weeks of the semester. Students’ safety and that of their belongings deserves special attention. Many universities see an increase in theft during this period of transition. Students should remember to not let others into the building without proper access.  Potentially suspicious activity should be reported to University Police by calling 540-654-1025.
