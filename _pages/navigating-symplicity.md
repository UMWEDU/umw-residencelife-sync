<h2>How to use Symplicity Residence roommate tools:</h2>
<strong>NOTE: Incoming first year students and those returning from a leave of absence should not use Symplicity Residence roommate tools.  First year students and those returning from a leave of absence will be paired with a roommate(s) based on the FSEM and answers to the roommate profile portion of the housing application respectively.</strong>  Current students should determine with whom they would like to live and form a group.  Each individual will have a specific individual selection time slot.  However, if in a group, the group’s average time slot will be used to select (by the group’s leader). Group leaders select the housing assignments on behalf of all members of the group.
<h3>Already have a roommate selected?</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Ask them for their roommate code (which can be found on the top right after logging into Symplicity Residence). Students should not give out their private roommate code unless they are sure they want to form a roommate group with the recipient.</li>
 	<li>Log into <a href="https://umw-residence.symplicity.com">Symplicity Residence</a>.</li>
 	<li>Click on “Roommates” at the top.</li>
 	<li>Select Fall 2017 term in the drop-down menu.</li>
 	<li>Click “Find someone you know.”</li>
 	<li>Next to “Enter a Roommate Code,” enter the code, and click “Send Invite.”</li>
 	<li>The person will need to log into the system to confirm roommate group acceptance.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Need to search for a roommate?</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Log into <a href="https://umw-residence.symplicity.com">Symplicity Residence</a>.</li>
 	<li>Click on “Roommates” at the top.</li>
 	<li>Select Fall 2017 term in the drop-down menu.</li>
 	<li>Click “Search resident profiles.”</li>
 	<li>Click “Change Search Filters.”</li>
 	<li>Select a criteria you consider important to search, and click “Submit.”</li>
 	<li>Click on “View Full Profile” to read more about the individual.</li>
 	<li>Once you find someone you think may be a potential roommate, you can click “Send Message” to message him/her through Symplicity Residence and initiate contact. All communication is done anonymously until a student decides to release his/her own information to another student. You can choose what you want to share (contact information, etc.) with the student. Be sure to ask questions.</li>
 	<li>If the two of you decide you are compatible roommates (and are sure about forming a roommate group), one should click “Invite” while browsing the other’s profile. The other will get a notification and must click to accept the roommate group invitation. Or, see above about Roommate Code.</li>
</ul>
<em>Remember when contacting students that they may already have roommates. Some may be looking only for apartment mates. And some are not searching at all (they may already have their group finalized).</em>
<h3>Groups</h3>
It is preferred that your group size match the space you wish to select. For instance, if you want to live in Eagle Landing, you will need a group of four total students (yourself, plus three others) to select the suite.  At selection time, the group leader will select the apartment and select the rooms where each person will live.  If two students want to select a residence hall double room, a group of two students (you and one other student) will need to be formed; the group leader would select the building and room at the selection time.

For groups larger than two: the Group Leader will need to add each person individually. If a group of two wants to be added to another group, they will have to disband and be added individually by the other group leader.
<h3>Open Rooms</h3>
For those students that are not in a roommate group, there will be a selection of rooms in most of the residence halls that will allow any amount of students within a group to select the space. This list will be available on the main page when you log into Symplicity Residence. Those in a group that have less than the size required of the room, suite, or apartment, will be able to select an Open Room and will have a random roommate assigned to the open spaces.
<h3>How to change your Group Leader:</h3>
The Group Leader is the only person who actually selects the housing assignments for the entire group. Therefore, if the Group Leader has a time conflict with the selection appointment, they should make another person in the group the leader.
<ul>
 	<li>The Group Leader would log into <a href="https://umw-residence.symplicity.com">Symplicity Residence</a>.</li>
 	<li>Click “Roommates,” select the term the group is in, and the group will then appear in the right side in the “My Group” box.</li>
 	<li>When hovering over a member’s name, the Group Leader can click the red “Up” arrow to make that member the new Group Leader. The previous Group Leader’s name will then move to the members list.</li>
</ul>
