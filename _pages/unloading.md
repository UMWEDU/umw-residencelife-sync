<strong>Please follow these instructions to enter the campus and to reach your residence hall to unload your car at the beginning of the school year.  Follow the instructions of staff onsite.  Please keep your vehicle on paved areas only </strong>unless directed otherwise by University staff.  When your vehicle is empty, please park it off campus so others may move closer.

Maps and directions to campus can be found on the <a href="http://www.umw.edu/visitors/">visitors' page</a>.
