<h3><strong>Themed Living Communities</strong></h3>
Students have the opportunity to create and participate in their own residential learning community called Themed Living Communities (TLC). By creating a community, students create high impact learning experiences outside the classroom that focus on reflection and small group discussion around a chosen academic, vocational, or extracurricular interest. More information about TLCs can be found at <u><a href="http://www.umw.edu/residencelife/on-campus/life/tlcs/">http://www.umw.edu/residencelife/on-campus/life/tlcs/</a></u>.

To create a community, please complete the <u><a href="https://orgsync.com/59554/forms/166472">TLC application</a></u> by February 14. Applications will be reviewed and notifications will be made by February 15.

All approved Themed Living Communities will be added to the Housing Application, allowing students to express interest in joining a community. Our goal is to maximize a students’ ability to participate in one of these high-impact practices. Themed Living Community leaders will be expected to welcome interested students into their community, based upon availability.
<h3><strong>ODR Approved Accommodations</strong></h3>
Students who have approved housing accommodations through the Office of Disability Services that limit the options on campus to fulfill the accommodation will have an opportunity to select their room or be manually assigned by Residence Life and Housing prior to general Selection. All students should expect to self-select their room within the Housing Portal unless otherwise directed by Residence Life and Housing.

Since accommodations are often very individual in nature, Residence Life and Housing will communicate with each student on the approved ODR list regarding their housing for 2019-2020. In order to receive an assignment during the designated ODR date, students must have their accommodation re-approved and their Housing Application completed by March 12.

Students approved for moveable accommodations (Emotional Support Animals, bed shakers, etc.) will participate in general selection.
<h3><strong>Flexible Housing</strong></h3>
Flexible Housing is an option in which any students, regardless of gender, may choose to share the same room, suite, or apartment. Flexible Housing provides a range of options that respond to students' diverse backgrounds, interests, preferences, and needs with the goal of improving retention and student success.

Flexible Housing is a fully opt-in housing option for upperclass students. A unit (room, suite, apartment) must be filled with students who are willing to live together. All students must not only opt into Flexible Housing, but they all must approve their roommates. Students are not placed randomly with other students in Flexible Housing. No student will be assigned to a gender-neutral living situation without their express consent. UMW discourages students who are in a romantic relationship from living together.

Students are eligible for Flexible Housing if they:
<ul>
 	<li>Are a current residential student applying for housing for the upcoming academic year</li>
 	<li>Have submitted a complete Housing and Dining Application for the upcoming academic year and have answered “yes” to the Flexible Housing opt in question.</li>
 	<li>Have identified and confirmed enough roommates to fill a full unit (traditional room- 2, suite- 4, apartment- 2, 3 or 4 based on layout)</li>
</ul>
All applicants must agree to live with each other and agree to follow all policies/procedures.
<ul>
 	<li>Students participating in Flexible Housing will be manually assigned by the Residence Life &amp; Housing staff or be able to select from available rooms after the office confirms all students’ opt in status, full approval of all roommates, and the ability to fill a unit. Residence Life &amp; Housing staff will communicate directly with each Flexible Housing group on the process moving forward.</li>
 	<li>Should an opening occur within the Flexible Housing unit, the space will be filled by one of the following methods:
<ul>
 	<li>Students in the unit will have two business days to notify Residence Life &amp; Housing of another roommate to fill the vacancy. This person must either be currently living on campus or eligible for on-campus housing and agree to a Flexible Housing arrangement. All roommates must approve the proposed occupant and vice versa.</li>
 	<li>Students within the group may all agree to a roommate who also applied for Flexible Housing, but not yet assigned to a Flexible Housing unit.</li>
 	<li>If the students in the group do not select another roommate or agree to have an approved applicant placed to fill the vacancy, the unit will move from Flexible Housing to gender-specific housing. This could result in students being reassigned or moved to different spaces. The Residence Life &amp; Housing staff will work with students to facilitate any necessary moves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Requests for room changes will be handled in the same manner regardless of the type of housing in which a student resides; however, students will have the option to move within Flexible and single-sex housing, as long as all criteria are met.</li>
</ul>
It is the students' choice to tell their parent or guardian about their decision to live in Flexible housing. We encourage students to maintain an open dialogue with their families so that they can be supportive of their housing decision.
<h3><strong>Same Room Sign-Up – March 21</strong></h3>
Current residents living on campus have the option to select their same (current) room for next year by participating in the Same Room Sign-Up selection process. This allows for students to go in ahead of the general selection and choose their space, and in many cases, pull in roommates. There are a small number of spaces that will not be able to part of the Same Room Sign-Up process. Students whose rooms are not available for Same Room Sign-Up will be classified as “displaced” and will have their own time to go into the Housing Portal and select their room. Students wishing to sign up for their same room will need to have a completed Housing Application and will need to indicate their interest for Same Room Sign-Up on that Application. <em>Students who participate in Same Room Sign-Up who do not pull in a roommate or do not have a roommate who is also participating, will have a vacancy in their room which will be filled</em>.
<h3><strong>Same Room Sign-Up Roommate Pull-In – March 25</strong></h3>
Students are encouraged to speak to their current roommates if they are planning on selecting their same room. If their roommate is also planning to participate in Same Room Sign-Up, then roommates will not be able to be pulled in for next year since the spaces will be filled. If you are participating and your roommate is not participating you can pull in a roommate during the Roommate Pull-In process. Students wishing to do this will need to have created a roommate group or have been made leader of a roommate group. Anyone who wishes to be pulled into a vacancy will need to have a completed Housing Application.
<h3><strong>Roommate Groups</strong></h3>
Residents who are participating in the 2019-2020 Housing Selection process have the ability to manage their own spaces and assignments. Students are able to go into the Housing Portal and find a vacancy and assign themselves to that vacancy. Students can also assign their own roommates to those vacancies if they have formed and verified a roommate group. Roommate groups can be as small as two participants (a group leader and a resident) and as large as four (a group leader and three others). Only the group leader is able to assign others to spaces in the system. <em>Per the Housing Agreement, any student assigned to a space by a group leader is considered to have selected that space and will be obligated to the same terms and conditions as if they selected the space themselves</em>. All participants of a roommate group must have a completed Housing Application in order to receive an assignment through this process. It is important that students check their UMW email and the Housing Portal messages throughout the selection process for information.

Roommate groups should be formed with the desired housing in mind. You should only have as many members as spaces in the room you would like to select during the Housing Selection process. It is also important to be realistic about the housing inventory. For example, we have limited three-person apartments available, but many students desire these accommodations. It is important to be thoughtful as to where you will be in the process and subsequent availability of desired spaces.
<h3><strong>General Room Selection Process</strong></h3>
Students who have filled out a Housing Application and have not participated in selection for TLC, Flexible Housing, Same Room Sign-Up, ODR, Displaced) will go through the general selection process to select their room for next year. They will also be allowed to assign roommates if they have a roommate group and a vacant room/suite/apartment is selected. The general Housing Selection process is based off of student classification with rising seniors going first, followed by juniors, and then sophomores. Each student will receive a time slot which will let them know when they can log in to search for and select a room space. The time slots will be given out in a lottery fashion to make the process as fair as possible. Time slots will be delivered to student’s UMW email address on March 29.

When the date and time on a student's time slot arrives, that student will be able to log into the Housing Portal and search for rooms based on building, floor, and room number. When the student finds the room they want, they can select it and assign themselves to the space. <em>It is important to check the room to ensure it has the desired number of vacancies BEFORE assigning anyone to the room.</em> If they have a roommate group and are the group leader, they can also then assign the roommates to the other vacancies in the room if there are any. Please remember to keep your roommate group to the same size as the room you want to select. It is recommended that the members of a roommate group discuss their time slots and the person with the earliest time slot be made the group leader.

Once a room has been selected and roommates assigned (if applicable) an email will be sent to the student’s UMW email address letting them know they have completed the Housing Selection process.
<h3>Meal Plan Information</h3>
Students living on campus will select their meal plans after they have selected a room assignment. This allows the system to populate meal plans based on your location and credit hours. Anyone with less than 90 credits and not living in Eagle Landing or the UMW Apartments can choose from the 150, 225, or Eagle meal plans. Seniors with 90 credits or more, and students choosing to live in Eagle Landing or the UMW Apartments have the additional option of choosing lower meal plans such as the 75 or 90 meal block plans.
