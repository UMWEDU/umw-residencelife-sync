<h2>What to Bring</h2>
Most electrical appliances (i.e. televisions, DVDs, stereos, radios, mini-refrigerator/freezers, computers/printers, hair dryers and irons) are permissible in residence halls. However, due to safety considerations, flame or spark-producing items (i.e. candles, halogen lamps, incense burners, oil burning lamps, lanterns and space heaters) are not permitted. Refer to further residential policies as noted in the <a href="http://publications.umw.edu/student-handbook/">Student Handbook</a>, and in the <a href="http://www.umw.edu/residencelife/before-you-get-to-campus/services-agreement/">Housing and Dining Services Agreement</a>.
<h4>Please use this <a href="https://www.umw.edu/residencelife/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2020/07/COVID-Eagle-Approved-list-2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eagle Approved list</a> to assist you with items to bring (and not bring) for Move-In.</h4>
<h2>Packing</h2>
As you pack, follow this basic rule-of-thumb: If you use it, like it or need it, then bring it. Orientation Leaders will help carry your belongings into your room on move-in day. Just remember that you will physically have to carry everything out of your room at the end of the year.

Bring the things that keep you happy, help you relax, or fill spare moments â€“ things like athletic equipment, musical instruments, games and videos. Pets (unless they are fish) are not allowed in University-operated housing.

No matter how well you prepare, chances are you may forget something. Keep in mind that many of the items you will need are available for sale in the Bookstore. If you cannot locate the items on campus, the stores in downtown Fredericksburg, Central Park, and the other shopping centers nearby are certain to have what you need.
