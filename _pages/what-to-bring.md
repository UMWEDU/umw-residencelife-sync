With the exceptions of Alvey and Randolph Halls, First-Year housing is not air-conditioned and room air-conditioners are not permitted, unless a request has been submitted to the Office of Residence Life and approved by the Assistant Director of Housing. Most electrical appliances (i.e. televisions, DVDs, stereos, radios, mini-refrigerator/freezers, computers/printers, hair dryers and irons) are permissible in residence halls. However, due to safety considerations, flame or spark-producing items (i.e. candles, halogen lamps, incense burners, oil burning lamps, lanterns and space heaters) are not permitted. Refer to further residential policies as noted in the <a href="http://publications.umw.edu/student-handbook/">Student Handbook</a>, and in the <a href="http://www.umw.edu/residencelife/before-you-get-to-campus/services-agreement/">Housing and Dining Services Agreement</a>.

</ul>
<h2>Desk Items:</h2>
Desk lamp, pencils, pens, notebook, writing paper, stamps, envelopes, address book, paper clips, rubber bands, stapler and staples, ruler, note cards (various sizes), glue, transparent tape, writing style manual, thumb tacks, calendar, and/or appointment book.
<h2>Personal Items:</h2>
Bed linen &amp; towels, blankets, pillows, manicure set, sewing kit, hair dryer, iron, laundry bag or basket, toiletry articles, plastic bucket (to carry into bathroom), soap dish.
<h2>Clothing:</h2>
Bring clothes which are comfortable and fit your own personal style. UMW students wear everything from sweats to silk. Storage space should be sufficient for most students, but closet sizes vary. If you suspect you may not have enough room, you may want to bring a trunk or stackable crates (which can reasonably fit underneath your bed). The average under-bed space is approximately 10 inches.  Planning a wardrobe specific to the season and exchanging clothing over breaks will also help provide you with enough room for all your belongings.
<h2>Miscellaneous Items:</h2>
Fan, wastebasket, multiple outlet surge protected power strips (UL approved, heavy duty type w/circuit breaker; be advised regular extension cords are not allowed!), mini fridge (2 amps / 4.5 cubic feet or less) – one per room except in quads where two are permitted), alarm clock, flashlight, radio or stereo, bottle and can opener, Safe materials for hanging posters to avoid damage to walls (white sticky tack, 3M products – NO duct tape or masking tape), cleaning supplies, dishes and flatware, cups and mugs, air freshener, drying rack for clothes, hangers, shoe rack, small tool kit, straight and safety pins, umbrella, non-prescription medicines, remote for TV and chargers for various electronics. Also keep in mind if you wish to hang curtains or draperies in the residence halls, they must be non-combustible and flame resistant.
<h2>Cable Television / Internet Access</h2>
All student rooms have an active cable television connection; however, students must bring their own T.V. sets and cable cords. Computer access to the Internet and the University’s network is also available from all student rooms. Students need to provide their own Ethernet cord and ensure that their computer has Ethernet capabilities in the form of a network card.
<h2>Packing</h2>
As you pack, follow this basic rule-of-thumb: If you use it, like it or need it, then bring it. Orientation Leaders will help carry your belongings into your room on move-in day. Just remember that you will physically have to carry everything out of your room at the end of the year.

Bring the things that keep you happy, help you relax, or fill spare moments – things like athletic equipment, musical instruments, games and videos. Pets (unless they are fish) are not allowed in University-operated housing.

No matter how well you prepare, chances are you may forget something. Keep in mind that many of the items you will need are available for sale in the Bookstore. If you cannot locate the items on campus, the stores in downtown Fredericksburg, Central Park, and the other shopping centers nearby are certain to have what you need.
