The Office of Residence Life and Housing employs approximately 75 Resident Assistants (RAs) who are at least second-semester first-year students. Working closely with full-time Area Coordinators (ACs), the RA is responsible for the overall supervision of a residence hall floor or apartment community of approximately 25-50 residents.

As a member of the Residence Life and Housing staff, RAs works to foster the development of a community on a floor or apartment area through a variety of methods. It is important for RAs to be willing to develop the interpersonal skills necessary for working with a wide variety of people. Resident Assistants should have a genuine interest in working with other students and helping these students develop intellectually, socially, and culturally.

Resident Assistants are the foundation of the Housing staff and have the responsibility to serve as an administrator, organizer, programmer and role model for the residents of their hall or apartment areas. The RA position is considered the principal out-of-class activity and any competing employment, interests and activities must be approved in advance by the Office of Residence Life and Housing.

<h3>Resident Assistant Application</h3>
View and apply for the RA position by visiting careers.umw.edu and clicking "Student Employment." You will be able to search for the application on that page. The application consists of biographical information and asks for one professional reference. Once you have completed the application, someone from the Residence Life and Housing team will reach out to you to confirm a date and time for your individual and group process interviews.

The Resident Assistant application never closes. There are priority guidelines for applicants in order to go through the full process.
<h3>Individual Interviews</h3>
Candidates are interviewed by staff members of the Office of Residence Life and Housing. You can expect to be asked a series of questions pertaining to your interest in the role, awareness of the position, leadership potential, community building, and multiculturalism. The interview will take approximately 45 minutes.
<h3>Group Process Interviews</h3>
Group Process interviews are essentially an experiential interview. As long as all application materials have been submitted and academic requirements are met, all RA applicants will participate. During Group Process interviews, you will be led through a series of interactive activities by experienced facilitators. You will also be observed and subsequently evaluated by members of the Residence Life and Housing team. The evaluators will be observing how you interact with your peers, your leadership skills, and the way you espouse or demonstrate the qualities that we are looking for in our RA staff.
<h3>Alternate Pool</h3>
The Alternate Pool is for those candidates for the Resident Assistant position who are qualified and have the skills to be a Resident Assistant, but we, unfortunately, do not have a position available at the time. If there should be a Resident Assistant position vacancy, professional staff from the Office of Residence Life and Housing will review and select candidates from the Alternate Pool. Candidates in the Alternate Pool will be notified via phone and e-mail if they are offered a position.

Alternate Pool candidates are eligible for hire until the next RA Selection Process.
<h3>RA Training<u>
</u></h3>
Resident Assistant Training is mandatory for all hired RAs. Resident Assistants come back early in August and January for training. Housing and meals are provided during this time.
<h3>RA Class</h3>
The RA Class is an opportunity to get further acquainted with the Office of Residence Life and Housing, meet your fellow staff members for the next year, and complete paperwork pertaining to employment. Class time is TBD.  The class will be held virtually.
<h3>Fall RA Training</h3>
Fall training takes place in the month of August and is designed to teach RAs the necessary skills to be a residential leader in our communities. At the end of the training, RAs have the practical knowledge to carry out RA responsibilities and a philosophical understanding of why those responsibilities exist. In addition, RAs bond with other RAs all of whom will be great resources to build community in our residence halls.
<h3>Winter Training</h3>
Winter training takes place in the month of January. RAs will return to campus before other UMW students. Winter training is designed to introduce and train new RAs, to further strengthen the cohesiveness of the group, and to redress problematic areas of the fall semester.

RA benefits are subject to change based on budgetary allocations and administrative decisions. Finalized RA compensation will be outlined in the offer letter for review prior to acceptance of the position.
