The Office of Residence Life and Housing employs approximately 75 Resident Assistants (RAs) who are at least second semester first-year students. Working closely with full-time Area Coordinators (ACs), the RA is responsible for the overall supervision of a residence hall floor or apartment community of approximately 25-50 residents.

As a member of the Residence Life and Housing staff, RAs works to foster the development of a community in a floor or apartment area through a variety of methods. It is important for RAs to be willing to develop interpersonal skills necessary for working with a wide variety of people. Resident Assistants should have a genuine interest in working with other students and helping these students develop intellectually, socially, and culturally.

Resident Assistants are the foundation of the staff and have the responsibility to serve as an administrator, organizer, programmer and role model for the residents of their hall or apartment areas. The RA position is considered the principal out-of-class activity and any competing employment, interests and activities must be approved in advance by the Office of Residence Life and Housing.

<h2>Important Information and Timeline</h2>
<h3>Information Sessions</h3>
Information Sessions are meet and greet informational meetings that any student interested in applying to be a Resident Assistant can attend.  Current Resident Assistants and professional staff members will provide you with background information about what the RA job entails, what the application process looks like, what to expect throughout the process, and can answer almost any question you may have.

Information Sessions will be held at 7:30pm in the University Center Colonnade Room:
- Thursday, January 25
- Monday, January 29
<h3>Area Information Nights</h3>
Over the course of the application period, Resident Assistants and Area Coordinators will host informal information nights in the residence halls.  These staff members will be happy to assist you with questions regarding the RA application process and being a Resident Assistant in general.  Keep coming back to this website and look out in your residence halls for times and locations.
<h3>Resident Assistant Application</h3>
The RA Application is available on the Office of Residence Life and Housing portal on myUMW.  The application consists of biographical information and asks about your availability for individual interviews and group process interviews and two professional references.
The Resident Assistant Application never closes.  There are priority guidelines for applicants in order to go through the full process.

Priority is given to students who complete their applications by Friday, February 9, 2018.  Those students who do not turn in an application by the priority deadline may not be interviewed during the formal process but will receive further information and instructions after the formal process has concluded.
<h3>References</h3>
All candidates are required to provide a minimum of two references as part of the application.  The references may be from any professional with whom you have worked, by whom you have been mentored, or who may provide particular insight on your abilities and character. References may not be a friend or family member.  Your references must be willing to complete a reference form on your behalf.  We recommend that you are in communication with your references throughout the process.  It is your responsibility to ensure that your references have completed and submitted the reference form by Friday, February 9, 2018.
<h3>Group Process Interviews</h3>
Group Process Interviews are essentially an experiential interview.  As long as all application materials have been submitted and academic requirements are met, all RA applicants will participate.  During Group Process Interviews, you will be led through a series of interactive activities by two experienced facilitators.  You will also be observed and subsequently evaluated by members of the Residence Life and Housing staff.  The evaluators will be observing how you interact with your peers, your leadership skills, and the way you espouse or demonstrate the qualities that we are looking for in our RA staff.

Group Process Interviews will take place on either Saturday, February 17 or Sunday, February 18.
<h3>Individual Interviews</h3>
Candidates are interviewed by staff members of the Office of Residence Life and Housing.  You can expect to be asked a series of questions pertaining to your interest in the role, awareness of the position, leadership potential, community building, and multiculturalism.  The interview will take approximately 45 minutes.

Individual Interviews will be scheduled by Area Coordinators for Monday, February 19 through Friday, March 2.
<h3>Applicants studying abroad in Spring 2018</h3>
In the event that you will not be physically present on campus during the interview dates, alternate arrangements (including the possibility of an interview by Skype) will be made available.  Please notify Colin Coleman, Assistant Director for Student Leadership and Residence Education to set up this opportunity.
<h3>Alternate Pool</h3>
The Alternate Pool is for those candidates for the Resident Assistant position who are qualified and have the skills to be a Resident Assistant, but we unfortunately do not have a position available at the time.  If there should be a Resident Assistant position vacancy, professional staff from the Office of Residence Life and Housing will review and select candidates from the Alternate Pool.  Candidates in the Alternate Pool will be notified via phone and e-mail if they are offered a position.

Alternate Pool candidates are eligible for hire until the next RA Selection Process begins in the Spring 2019.

<h3>RA Training<u>
</u></h3>
Resident Assistant Trainings are mandatory for all hired RAs.
<h5>Spring Kick-Off</h5>
Spring Kick-Off is an opportunity to get further acquainted with the Office of Residence Life and Housing, meet your fellow staff members for the next year, and complete paperwork pertaining to employment.  RA Spring Kick-Off will be held on Sunday, April 22, 2018.
<h5>Fall RA Training</h5>
Fall training takes place in the month of August and is designed to teach RAs the necessary skills to be a residential leader in our communities. At the end of training, RAs have the practical knowledge to carry out RA responsibilities and a philosophical understanding of why those responsibilities exist. In addition, RAs bond with other RAs all of whom will be great resources to build community in our residence halls.
<h5>Winter Training</h5>
Winter training takes place in the month of January. RAs will return to campus before other UMW students. Winter training is designed to introduce and train new RAs, to further strengthen the cohesiveness of the group, and to redress problematic areas of the fall semester.
<h3>RA Benefits</h3>
Resident Assistants receive a reduced room rate credit and a stipend paid out over 18 equal payments.  While the benefits of a reduced room rate and stipend are certainly a perk, those students who are only applying for this reason are encouraged to think again.  The RA position is a job.  It requires the person to be truly dedicated to making living in the Residence Halls a positive experience for others.
Other benefits RAs received include:

- Professional Development opportunities (conference attendance, training, etc…)
- Leadership Development
- Communication Strategies and Development (through connections with faculty, staff, and students)
- Marketable Skill Development
