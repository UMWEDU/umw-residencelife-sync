If you love the University of Mary Washington as much as you say you do, the Office of Residence Life and Housing invites you to apply to become a Resident Assistant!

Resident Assistants possess strong leadership skills and a commitment to build quality relationships in not only their residential community, but all across the UMW campus.

RAs play an integral part in the overall operation of the residence halls. Primarily, the RA is concerned with the growth and development of each individual on his/her floor and the building community as a whole. Additionally, RAs are continually striving to enhance the quality of life for those residents. This includes planning programs, promoting inclusion, assisting with personal and professional growth, and most importantly enjoying their time at UMW. Most of all, it’s a very fun and rewarding job with many benefits.

The responsibilities below outline the general expectations of the Resident Assistant. Due to the nature of this position, which can be unpredictable and evolves as the needs of the campus change, there may be variations or additions to this list. RAs may also be asked to help with other duties as assigned by a professional staff member.
