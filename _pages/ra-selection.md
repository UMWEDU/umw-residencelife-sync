If you love the University of Mary Washington as much as you say you do, the RA Selection Committee invites you to apply to become a Resident Assistant!

Resident Assistants possess strong leadership skills and a commitment to build quality relationships in not only their residential community, but all across the UMW campus.

RAs play an integral part in the overall operation of the residence halls. Primarily, the RA is concerned with the growth and development of each individual on his/her floor and the building community as a whole. Additionally, RAs are continually striving to enhance the quality of life for those residents. This includes planning programs, promoting diversity, assisting with personal and professional growth, and most importantly enjoying their time at UMW. Overall, it’s a very fun and rewarding job with many benefits.

The responsibilities below outline the general expectations of the Resident Assistant. Due to the nature of this position, which can be unpredictable and evolves as the needs of the campus change, there may be variations or additions to this list. RAs may also be asked to help with other duties as assigned by a professional staff member.
<h2>Resident Assistant Job Description 2016-2017</h2>
The Resident Assistant (RA) is an experienced UMW student who serves as a member of the Office of Residence Life and Commuter Student Services staff, caring for and supporting UMW’s residential population. Through their presence and outreach, RAs positively shape the on-campus living experience, while enhancing their own leadership skills (time management, interpersonal communication, budgeting, public speaking, and conflict resolution). Few campus employment opportunities provide students with the scope and depth of this position. Though the RA position requires a significant time commitment, RAs should be prepared for an incredibly rewarding and challenging experience where they can impact the lives of many students.
<h3>Key Position Highlights</h3>
Resident Assistants serve many roles including: educator, community builder, role model, resource and administrator. They are responsible for fostering student learning and growth, building an inclusive community, forming personal relationships and encouraging residents and staff members to be accountable for their choices and actions. RAs utilize a variety of methods to focus and align their efforts to the over-arching educational priority that students will use critical thinking to make sound decisions. The RA position is a paraprofessional position within the Office of Residence Life and Commuter Student Services. The RA will have a direct supervisor and will receive indirect supervision from other professional staff within the department. The RA’s main purpose is to develop and maintain an engaging, supportive environment which encourages the pursuit of excellence in support of the mission and vision of the University.
