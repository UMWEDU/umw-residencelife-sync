At UMW, we believe that living on-campus can have a significant positive effect on the success of students, both academically and holistically.  Approximately seventy-five percent of your time at college will be spent outside of the classroom, but learning does not stop at the doors of the academic buildings.

The residential experience at UMW promotes the ideal of seamless learning where students connect real world experiences with formal classroom knowledge in order to <strong>realize responsibility for their self, their community, and their world</strong>.  As part of living on-campus students will learn and demonstrate personal responsibility, community responsibility, and global responsibility.
