<h2>Housing Selection Process Step by Step</h2>
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Decide if you will live on campus or off next year.</strong>  <strong>NOTE:</strong><strong> </strong> First year students are required to live on campus for their second year.  Students who fail to complete the 2nd Year Fulfillment application will be manually assigned.</li>
 	<li><strong>Review <a href="http://www.umw.edu/residencelife/before-you-get-to-campus/housing-selection/rates/">room and board rates</a></strong> with the person/people paying the bill.</li>
 	<li><strong>Review and understand the terms and conditions of the <a href="http://www.umw.edu/residencelife/before-you-get-to-campus/services-agreement/">Housing and Dining Agreement</a> </strong>as it is a legally binding agreement between the student and the University.</li>
 	<li><strong>Review <a href="https://umw.sodexomyway.com/dining-plans/index.html">meal plan options.</a></strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Not sure you want to live on campus next year?  DO NOT PROCEED.</strong><strong>  </strong>This does not apply to first year students who must complete their 2 year residency requirement.</li>
 	<li><strong>Complete Housing and Dining Application in <a href="https://umw-residence.symplicity.com/">Symplicity Residence</a></strong> by the appropriate deadline.  <strong>NOTE</strong>:  First year students must complete the housing application in Symplicity Residence to update their roommate matching profile and select a meal plan.</li>
 	<li><strong>Select roommates and create roommate group in <a href="https://umw-residence.symplicity.com/">Symplicity Residence</a>.  </strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Discuss with roommates where you want to live.</strong>  You should select at least 3 options in case your first choice is not available at your housing selection time.  <a href="http://www.umw.edu/residencelife/residence-halls/">Review housing options</a>.</li>
 	<li><strong>Review Housing Selection Details below.</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Group Leader selects housing during assigned housing selection appointment time in Symplicity Residence.</strong></li>
</ol>

<h2>Housing Selection Highlights</h2>
<strong>Housing Selection will consist of 2 processes:</strong>  Pre-Process selection, and Main Housing selection.

<strong>Each student will receive a housing selection appointment time  based on class standing and the date of housing agreement submission.</strong>  Eg.  Students who have more credit hours and submitted their housing agreement earlier will have better times.

<strong>Roommate groups will select housing during the time assigned to the person with the earliest selection time.</strong>  Eg. A roommate group with 2 students one with a time of 10am and one with a time of 3pm may select housing at or after 10am. *This person does not have to be the group leader.
