<h2><strong>Rediscover Home for 2019-2020!</strong></h2>
Welcome to the Returning Student Housing Selection Page!  We are excited you are planning to live on-campus with us again next year.  UMW and national data shows that students who live on campus are more likely to succeed academically and have an overall more enjoyable experience at UMW.

We have provided a wealth of information about housing selection below and within the links provided.  Please read everything thoroughly and contact our office if you have questions.  For students participating in specific processes, additional information will be sent via email after applications are submitted.

Please note: First year students who sign an agreement to live on campus during 2018-2019 are bound by the two-year residency requirement and may not choose to change to commuter status without being released by the Contract Review Committee. Students obligated to the second-year fulfillment who do not participate in the Housing Selection process will still be assigned a space and be held to the terms and conditions of the Housing and Dining Agreement.

</ul>
<h2><strong>Options for Upperclassmen</strong></h2>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Manual Assignment by Residence Life and Housing</strong> – certain circumstances require the Residence Life and Housing staff to manually assign students to rooms.  This includes some ODR accommodations, Flexible Housing groups, or Themed Living Communities.  Our goal is to provide as many students as possible the opportunity to use the Housing Portal to select their space; if a manual assignment is needed, a member of the Residence Life and Housing team will let you know prior to the Housing Selection process.</li>
 	<li><strong>Same Room Sign Up</strong> – students who currently reside in an upperclass hall have the opportunity to select their same room for the following year, if available. Students will be asked during the application process if they plan to Same Room Sign-Up and will receive confirmation on the availability of their room for this process.  Students whose rooms are not available for Same Room Sign-Up will be classified as “displaced” and will have their own time to go into the Housing Portal and select their room.</li>
 	<li><strong>Self Select a Room</strong>- students who are not part of the aforementioned groups will be assigned a room selection time to go into the Housing Portal and select a space from all available rooms. If part of a verified roommate group, the group leader will assign all group members during their selection time.</li>
</ul>
