<h2 style="text-align: center">2020-2021 Housing Selection postponed until
April 7<sup>th</sup>.</h2>
With the university-wide change to remote learning and with most of our students off campus, we want to make sure that our messaging and ability to support does not conflict with updates to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.  We feel that it is best to postpone the Housing Selection process until we can ensure maximum support, either in person or virtually.

Housing Selection will be postponed and will tentatively start on April 7th with Flex Housing and TLC room selection.  The new dates for Housing Selection will be:
<ul>
 	<li>TLC and Flex Housing Selection <strong>April 7th-8th</strong></li>
 	<li>Same Building Sign Up <strong>April 9th–10th</strong></li>
 	<li>Move In Crew Housing Selection <strong>April 13th-14th</strong></li>
 	<li>4-3-2-1 General Housing Selection <strong>April 15th-22nd</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>4 Person Roommate Groups <strong>April 15th-16th</strong></li>
 	<li>3 Person Roommate Groups <strong>April 16th-17th</strong></li>
 	<li>2 Person Roommate Groups <strong>April 20th-21st</strong></li>
 	<li>1 Person – Individuals selecting a single space <strong>April 21st-22nd</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Please rest assured that moving Housing Selection will not change your ability to participate in options like Flex Housing or Same Building Sign Up.  Your roommate groups will remain intact and you will still be able to select your space and fill the rest of the spaces with your roommate group. Keep an eye on your UMW email account for additional information and instructions.

The office of Residence Life and Housing is still open and we will be happy to answer any questions you may have.  Due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, there may be times during normal operating hours the front desk staff is working remotely.  For the quickest response, please send an email to <a href="mailto:reslife@umw.edu">reslife@umw.edu</a>.  We are also checking voicemail periodically and will return your call as soon as possible.

We ask that you do not make any in-person visits to Marye House without first confirming a meeting with a specific professional staff member.

Thank You,

Residence Life and Housing

<h2 style="text-align: center"><strong>Students applying for 2020-2021 Housing will use the application found on the <a href="https://umw.starrezhousing.com/starrezportal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Housing Portal</u></a>.</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>Rediscover Home for 2020-2021!</strong></h2>
Welcome to the returning student Housing Selection page! We are excited you are planning to live on campus with us again next year. UMW and national data shows that students who live on campus are more likely to succeed academically and have an overall more enjoyable experience at UMW.

We have provided a wealth of information about Housing Selection below and within the links provided. Please read everything thoroughly and contact our office if you have questions. For students participating in specific processes, additional information will be sent via email after applications are submitted.

Please note: First year students who sign an agreement to live on campus during 2019-2020 are bound by the two-year residency requirement and may not choose to change to commuter status without being released by the Contract Review Committee. Students obligated to the second-year fulfillment who do not participate in the Housing Selection process will still be assigned a space and be held to the terms and conditions of the Housing and Dining Agreement.

 	<li>Apr 9-10: <strong>Same Building Sign-Up</strong> process opens; students who have signed up to live in their same building will choose their space on this day (reminder: students must fill their entire room, apartment, or suite). Roommates must be placed at this time.</li>

 	<li>Apr 15-22: <strong>new 4-3-2-1 process for Housing Selection</strong>; group leaders will log in during their assigned time slot and select their room space as well as assign their own roommates</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Options for Upperclass Students</strong></h2>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Manual Assignment by Residence Life and Housing</strong> – Certain circumstances require Residence Life and Housing staff to manually assign students to rooms. This includes some ODR accommodations, Flexible Housing groups, or Themed Living Communities. Our goal is to provide as many students as possible the opportunity to use the Housing Portal to select their space; if a manual assignment is needed, a member of the Residence Life and Housing team will let you know prior to the Housing Selection process.</li>
 	<li><strong>Same Building Sign-Up</strong> – Students who currently reside in an upperclass hall have the opportunity to select their same building for the following year. Students will be asked during the application process if they plan to Same Building Sign-Up. Same Building Sign-Up requires students to fill their space or be consolidated if there are spaces open. Please note: this is not applicable to first-year students who live in first-year halls.</li>
 	<li><strong>Self Select a Room – </strong>Students who are not part of the aforementioned groups will be assigned a room selection time to go into the Housing Portal and select a space from the available rooms. If part of a verified roommate group, the group leader will assign all group members during their selection time.</li>
 	<li><strong>Must Fill Space</strong> – Students participating in Housing Selection, regardless of which process they are a part of, must fill their selected space. For example, if you sign up for a suite in Eagle Landing, you must have a roommate group that allows for you to fill all four spaces in the room. This goes for all spaces, including the UMW Apartments.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Housing Selection Process</h2>
Students participating in the new 4-3-2-1 process will choose their spaces for next year based on roommate group size and classification. Students who have a four-person group and have a group leader who is a Senior will select their spaces first on March 30th. Students with a four-person roommate group can only see and select spaces that match the number of students in the group. If you wish to live in the UMW Apartments, you will need to find an apartment that has four spaces available, but if you wish to live in Eagle Landing or a suite-style hall, you can select an entire apartment or entire suite. Once Seniors have selected, Juniors with a four-person roommate group will select, and then Sophomores, etc.

After the four-person roommate groups have gone, it will move on to the three-person roommate groups and will again begin with Seniors, move on to Juniors, and so on. Three-person roommate groups can only see and select spaces that have three vacancies, and no more. A three-person group can not select three spaces in Eagle Landing and leave one vacancy. Whatever space you choose, you will need to fill. After three-person groups, we will go by classification for two-person groups, and then finally for individuals who are not in a roommate group.

If there are vacancies in an apartment or suite, that apartment or suite will be subject to consolidation. This means if you select a single space in a 4 person apartment, you may be moved to another room or apartment in order to fill that apartment and open the apartment you were in. Consolidation will not change the type of room you have selected. For example, if you selected a single room, you will only be moved to a single room. If you have selected a double room you will only be moved to a double, etc. During consolidation, we will not break up roommate groups.
