The LGBTQ Learning Community <span class="s1">is a community housed in Madison Hall which embraces the concept of gender inclusive housing within the university setting. Members provide peer support and educate the campus community through programming and social initiatives that increase awareness about gender identity.  While this community brings about awareness and support around gender identity, individual housing units (bedrooms) are still assigned based on biological sex unless students opt into the Flexible Housing program.</span>
