<h2>Themed Living Communities for Upper-Class Students</h2>
UMW’s Themed Housing Communities provide upper-class students with the opportunity to live together and further engage in learning outside of the classroom.  Themed Housing Communities offer students the chance to bond with their peers through specialized programs and events while providing unique experiences to connect with faculty, staff, and community leaders!

Themed Housing Communities integrate academics, career preparedness, leadership, and social interactions with outside interests. Students can live with others who share their enthusiasm about specific topics! Although each Themed Housing Community has a different theme, the goals of Themed Housing Communities are to:
<ul>
	<li>Enhance student’s overall educational experiences;</li>
	<li>Foster learning through group activities;</li>
	<li>Establish a sense of community;</li>
	<li>Encourage support and respect of self, community, and world.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Previous Themed Housing Communities included:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Cooking And Gaming for Everyone (C.A.G.E.)</li>
	<li>Green House (Sustainable Living)</li>
	<li>International Living Community</li>
	<li>Korean Exchange Program</li>
	<li>Pawnee Goddesses (Women’s Leadership)</li>
	<li>Physically Active Fitness Friends (P.A.F.F.)</li>
	<li>UMW Dead Poets Society</li>
</ul>
We invite faculty, staff, and students to organize new communities which can be created for students of all majors.  Themed Housing Communities are able to apply for housing in any of the upperclass residence halls or apartments (Eagle Landing and UMW Apartments included).  Those participating in Themed Housing Communities also receive priority selection, selecting their housing prior to the general UMW population.
