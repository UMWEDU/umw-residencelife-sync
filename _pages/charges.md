The student’s responsibility for damage includes, but is not limited to, damage to room furnishings and damage caused from either inside the room or outside the room to doors, windows and screens.
<h2>Damage Assessment</h2>
The student is responsible for the condition and proper care of the accommodations assigned to him or her and shall reimburse the university for all damages done within or to said accommodations during the term of the UMW Agreement.  Any time a student departs a residence hall room or apartment Residence Life staff complete an assessment of the facility to determine if any damage occurred during the students period of occupancy by updating the departure portion of the room condition inventory. <strong>Charges are only assessed for damage, not normal wear and tear that occurs as a result of normal use.</strong> Pro rata charges for damage to public areas in the assigned residence hall may also be assessed, regardless of the identity of the person or persons responsible. The other common charge at the time of departure is for <a href="http://www.umw.edu/residencelife/on-campus/housing-procedures/key/">missing keys</a>.
<h2>Appealing Charges</h2>
All residence hall <a href="http://www.umw.edu/residencelife/on-campus/charges/appeal-process-for-housing-charges/">charges may be appealed</a> within 5 business days of notification.
