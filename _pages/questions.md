<h2>The Basics</h2>
<h3>Where do I go to get the most useful and up-to-date information regarding the Resident Assistant Selection Process?</h3>
You are already there…..on the website! The RA Selection website has the most up-to-date information regarding the RA Selection Process. You can find everything from important dates, necessary forms and answers, to the most frequently asked questions.
<h3>I want to become a Resident Assistant. What do I do, and when?</h3>
You are taking that first step now by visiting this website. Read through the entire site. If you still have questions, contact a Resident Assistant or the Office of Residence Life.
<h3>What do I get for being an RA?</h3>
Remuneration will consist of an academic year stipend equivalent to $4,100. RAs will also receive a room credit of $475 per semester ($950 for Eagle Landing RAs).
<h2>Application</h2>
<h3>When can I turn in my application and reference forms?</h3>
For the Fall 2017-Spring 2018 process, completed applications and reference forms must be submitted by 5pm on Friday, December 9, 2016 via MyUMW. Applications will not be collected after this date and time.
<h3>How do I apply if I am studying abroad during the Fall 2016 semester, and will miss the RA information sessions in November?</h3>
In this case, you can attend a special information session on Wednesday, January 25, 2017. This information session is only for new transfer students and those students who were abroad during the Fall 2016 semester.
<h3>How do I apply if I want to study abroad in the Spring 2017 semester?</h3>
The RA Selection process continues through the Spring semester. If you attend one of the information sessions during the Fall, which means that you will be missing the interviews and group process in the Spring, you will be required to complete a 2- to 3-page paper answering specific questions and turning it in to the RA Selection chair for review. Details will be provided upon request.
<h2>References</h2>
<h3>How do references work? Who should I get references from?</h3>
Applicants must have two references.  One of those references must be a current UMW staff member (professor, advisor, supervisor, etc.).  The second reference can be from a non-UMW or UMW professional.  You will need your reference’s e-mail addresses while filling out your application.  All references must be of a professional nature (not a family member or friend).

&nbsp;
<h2>Info Sessions &amp; Resume Workshop</h2>
<h3>What if I can’t attend any of the RA information sessions?</h3>
You will not be able to proceed with the process unless you can provide appropriate documentation for missing all RA information sessions, which will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. This documentation should be sent to Colin Coleman, Assistant Director of Residence Life at ccolema4@umw.edu. If you are studying abroad during the Fall 2015 semester, see the question above.
<h3>Do I have to go to a resume workshop? Does going to a resume workshop increase my chance to become a RA?</h3>
No, you are not required to attend a resume workshop in order to move forward in the process. However, going to a resume workshop will teach you how to make a resume that’s easy to read and one that emphasizes important things about your candidacy. Remember, you don’t have to wait until the resume workshop in order to get help in regards to how to build one. The Academic and Career Services Office offers programs and services in relation to resumes on an ongoing basis.
<h2>The Extras</h2>
<h3>Who can I talk to if I have further questions?</h3>
You can contact the Assistant Director of Residence Life Colin Coleman at <a href="mailto:ccolema4@umw.edu">ccolema4@umw.edu</a>.
<h3>What happens if I don’t complete part of the selection process, or if I miss a deadline?</h3>
You will NOT be able to continue in the RA selection process and will be ineligible to be hired.
<h3>Can I apply if I was documented for violating a University policy?</h3>
This will depend on whether you are currently under Student Conduct Sanction. If your sanctions have all passed at the time you submit your application, you will be able to continue in the process. Additional checks will be made throughout the selection process and if you are found to be under sanction during any of these checks, you will not be able to continue in the selection process.
<h3>How will I be notified of my status throughout the process?</h3>
Through your official University of Mary Washington e-mail address. This is the only way the RA Selection Committee will correspond with you so please be sure to check your e-mail regularly.
<h3>If I do not get hired, is there an opportunity for me to find out how I can improve for the future?</h3>
We offer feedback interviews to all candidates who are not deemed “hirable” after they have undergone the “group process” portion of the RA Selection process. This will give you the opportunity to speak with members of the RA Selection Committee and get useful feedback which can help you in the future.
