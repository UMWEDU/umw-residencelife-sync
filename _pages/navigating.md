<h2>Application Instructions</h2>
<h3>Before you apply</h3>
Please read the Terms and Conditions of the Housing and Dining Agreement. Similar to a lease, it is a legally binding contract.  In addition, please read all instructions below before proceeding.
<h4>How to apply for housing</h4>
Every residential student must pay a housing deposit in the amount of $250 either at the time of admission or upon returning to university housing. Students may not complete a housing application until a housing deposit is paid and processed, which takes roughly 48 business hours from receipt of deposit.

The deposit is held until the student departs campus housing. If there are no damages or other charges assessed on the student’s account at that time, the Office of Student Accounts will later process a refund. Students who are approved to be released from their Housing and Dining Services Agreement forfeit their housing deposit.

Newly admitted residential students must pay their housing deposit through the <a href="http://www.umw.edu/admissions/">Office of Admissions</a>.

All other students requesting to live in University housing must pay their deposit directly to the Office of Residence Life and Housing with a $250 check or money order (credit card and EagleOne payments are not accepted). It should be made out to "UMW" with the student’s Banner ID number (beginning with “000”) in the memo line, and brought to Marye House or mailed to:

UMW Residence Life
Attn: Michelle Brooks
1301 College Avenue
Fredericksburg, VA 22401

To pay a housing deposit in cash, email <a href="mailto:mesch@umw.edu">mesch@umw.edu</a> to make arrangements to bring exact change to Marye House.

<h2>Prior to Housing Selection</h2>
<h3>Creating a Roommate Group</h3>
In order to form a roommate group, a student will need to log into the housing system and navigate to the Roommate Group Page.  On that page the person who creates the group will automatically be set as the group leader.  You can change the leader at any time after the group is formed.  Each roommate group will have their own unique name.  This name is how potential members will find and join an open group.  Once the leader has set a name and password for the group they can then search for potential members in the system and send out invites, or they can invite their other members directly themselves.  Each person will need to log into the housing system, search for the roommate group by name, and log in with the password the leader set when they created the group.  Once in the group, each member will need to verify their participation by clicking on the verify button.
