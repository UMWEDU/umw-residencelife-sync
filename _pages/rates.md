<h3>Proposed Room Rates for 2019-2020</h3>
<div>Room rates have not yet been approved by the Board of Visitors,  however the University is proposing that all UMW-owned residence halls maintain rates consistent with 2018-2019 with no increase. Eagle Landing and UMW Apartments (UMW Foundation properties) anticipate a 3%-5% increase in rates for 2019-2020. The Board of Visitors will approve room rates during their April 2019 meeting.</div>

These housing rates reflect the 2018 – 2019 academic year. Please review the information carefully to ensure you are looking at the correct line.
