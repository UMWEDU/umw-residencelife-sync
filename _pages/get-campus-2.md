<h2><strong>Before you arrive:</strong></h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Pick up your EagleOne Card during Orientation. This is your student ID card and you will need it to check into your Residence Hall.</li>
 	<li>Read <a href="http://publications.umw.edu/eagleessentials/">Eagle Essentials</a></li>
 	<li>Read the residential policies in the <a href="http://publications.umw.edu/student-handbook/">student handbook</a></li>
 	<li>Contact your roommates to get to know each other and to discuss what items you will share and who is bringing what.</li>
 	<li>Review the <a href="http://www.umw.edu/residencelife/before-you-get-to-campus/move-in/prohibited-in-residence-halls/">prohibited items</a></li>
 	<li>Purchase and pack necessary items</li>
 	<li>Review your family insurance policy or purchase a renters insurance policy to protect your belongings while on campus.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Get to know your roommate:</h3>
While social media is convenient for quick introductions and sharing information we encourage you and your roommate to have a phone conversation or when possible a face-to-face meeting to learn about each other before move-in.
<h4>Keep in mind:</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>It is okay to feel apprehensive about speaking with your new roommate for the first time.</li>
 	<li>They are in the same situation you are, and probably have similar feelings as you.</li>
 	<li>The more you communicate with your new roommate now and when you arrive on campus, the better the relationship will ultimately be.</li>
</ul>
