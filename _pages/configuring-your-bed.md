All residents have the ability to choose the bed configuration they want. All beds are set to the standard "tall" configuration which consists of one headboard, one footboard, and the bed springs set at the highest setting (about 36 inches), with the mattress on top. Residents may lower the bed springs, bunk the beds, or loft the beds. It is entirely up to the resident to determine what bed configuration suits them best.

All beds must be returned back to their original "tall" state prior to moving out (either at end of year or when moving out due to room change). Failure to do so will result in a charge of $125 billed to the student.

If a resident wishes to change their bed configuration, they must contact their RA or Area Coordinator. A work order is not necessary and will be rejected by Facilities Services. Once the staff member is contacted, they will give the resident the parts they need to change the bed to the desired state. It is the resident's responsibility to make the changes. It is recommended that two or more people make the configuration changes together.

<h4>Bunk beds:</h4>
When both beds are placed parallel to each other – one on the bottom and the other above it.  Bed pins secure the bed boards to each other.  Both roommates would have to communicate with each other to determine if this is the best sleeping situation, who would sleep in either bed, etc.

<h4>Lofted bed:</h4>
When one bed’s boards are doubled and secured with bed pins (and a security bar) to be raised high above the ground. The mattress is placed high so other furniture items are in the space below the mattress to maximize space usage.  The highest a loft can be raised is just under 6 feet, ranging between 5`8 1/2" and 5`9".

<h4 style="clear: both">Bed Adjustments:</h4>
Resident Assistants have rubber mallets and can show students the proper way to adjust bed heights.  The beds can be adjusted anywhere from 21" to 36" off the ground. The bed in the photo is at the "tall" setting, the standard height across campus when students move in.
