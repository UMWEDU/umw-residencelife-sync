<h2>For 2020-2021:</h2>
<p class="p1">ResLife was able to secure a non-UMW contractor to place loft and bunk bed parts into student rooms before Move-In occurs. Students can sign up for a loft or bunk bed through the form found below. The deadline for loft and bunk bed requests is 11:59pm on August 3. Unfortunately, requests received after August 3 will not be able to be processed.</p>
<p class="p1">UMW makes every effort to ensure that all rooms are clean and move in ready, however, by requesting the parts to loft or bunk the bed, someone may be entering the student’s room after it has been cleaned. All bed parts will be delivered at least five days before students arrive on campus. The loft kit is the student’s responsibility and whether they chose to assemble the loft or not, they will need to keep the loft parts in their room until the end of the semester. As with all of our common areas and equipment, ResLife encourages students to sanitize and wash their hands after assembling the bed.</p>

<h2>How to:</h2>
All residents have the ability to choose the bed configuration they want. All beds are set to the standard "tall" configuration which consists of one headboard, one footboard, and the bed springs set at the highest setting (about 31" inches), with the mattress on top. Residents may lower the bed springs, bunk the beds, or loft the beds. It is entirely up to the resident to determine what bed configuration suits them best.

All beds must be returned back to their original "tall" state prior to moving out (either at end of year or when moving out due to room change). Failure to do so will result in a charge of $125 billed to the student.

If a resident wishes to change their bed configuration, they must contact their RA or Area Coordinator. A work order is not necessary and will be rejected by Facilities Services. Once the staff member is contacted, they will give the resident the parts they need to change the bed to the desired state. It is the resident's responsibility to make the changes. It is recommended that two or more people make the configuration changes together.

<h4>Bunk beds:</h4>
When both beds are placed parallel to each other – one on the bottom and the other above it.  Bed pins secure the bed boards to each other.  Both roommates would have to communicate with each other to determine if this is the best sleeping situation, who would sleep in either bed, etc.

<h4>Lofted bed:</h4>
When one bed’s boards are doubled and secured with bed pins (and a security bar) to be raised high above the ground. The mattress is placed high so other furniture items are in the space below the mattress to maximize space usage.  The highest a loft can be raised is just under 6 feet.

<h4 style="clear: both">Bed Adjustments:</h4>
Resident Assistants have rubber mallets and can show students the proper way to adjust bed heights.  The beds can be adjusted anywhere from 18" to 31" off the ground. The bed in the photo is at the "tall" setting, the standard height across campus when students move in. 31" is to the edge of the springs, and 32.5" from the floor to the springs .
<h2>Additional materials</h2>

Form to request materials to loft or bunk the bed located below. Please note: Early Arrivals (any arrival prior to Aug 21) should submit their request prior to Aug 12 to ensure the materials are in their rooms before arrival. If a student arrives early and has submitted the form after Aug 12, the student will need to wait until Aug 21, or until an RA becomes available to assist them in retrieving the materials.
