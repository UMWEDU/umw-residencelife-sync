<h2><strong>Before you arrive:</strong></h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Pick up your EagleOne Card during Orientation. This is your student ID card and you will need it to check into your Residence Hall.</li>
 	<li>Read <a href="http://publications.umw.edu/eagleessentials/">Eagle Essentials</a></li>
 	<li>Read the residential policies in the <a href="http://publications.umw.edu/student-handbook/">student handbook</a></li>
 	<li>Contact your roommates to get to know each other and to discuss what items you will share and who is bringing what.</li>
 	<li>Review the <a href="http://www.umw.edu/residencelife/before-you-get-to-campus/move-in/prohibited-in-residence-halls/">prohibited items</a> list. Be sure to leave these items at home.</li>
 	<li>Pack S.M.A.R.T.! Use the tips in our acronym and packing list found on our website to bring the right amount of belongings.</li>
 	<li>Review your family insurance policy or purchase a renter's insurance policy to protect your belongings while on campus.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Get to know your roommate:</h3>
While social media is convenient for quick introductions and sharing information we encourage you and your roommate to have a phone conversation or when possible a face-to-face meeting to learn about each other before move-in.  Be mindful that some students are traveling for the summer or may not be accessible via certain communication methods.  Be patient and don’t assume the worst.
<h4>Keep in mind:</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>It is okay to feel apprehensive about speaking with your new roommate for the first time.</li>
 	<li>They are in the same situation you are. Assume good will and give the relationship time.</li>
 	<li>The more you communicate with your new roommate now and when you arrive on campus, the better the relationship will ultimately be.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Check out this printable <a href="http://www.umw.edu/residencelife/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2016/06/Eagle-Approved-list.pdf">Ultimate UMW Packing List</a> for items that are Eagle Approved and those that are not permitted in your Nest.</strong>
<h4>Pack S.M.A.R.T.</h4>
<strong>S</strong>: Spend two weeks taking note of what you use at home. If you haven't used it in two weeks, don't pack it.

<strong>M</strong>: Make lists of "must-have" and "want" items. Prioritize your lists and leave the unnecessary things at home.

<strong>A</strong>: Assess the space needed to bring your possessions. Remember, you will more than likely share a room with someone else.

<strong>R</strong>: Remember, Virginia has seasonal weather. There is no need to bring all of your clothes at once. Use family visits, breaks, and holidays to switch out clothes.

<strong>T</strong>: Talk to your roommate about sharing certain items. Why bring two when one will suffice?

Most home good stores provide a fairly comprehensive list of items needed for college.  Please be aware that these lists sometimes include items that are prohibited at UMW.  Please review the <a href="http://www.umw.edu/residencelife/before-you-get-to-campus/move-in/prohibited-in-residence-halls/">prohibited items list</a> and keep these items out of your nest!

<strong>NOTE</strong>:  The University of Mary Washington does not provide storage for luggage, boxes, or the UMW provided furniture listed above.  Everything you bring must fit in your room.

<strong>NOTE</strong>:  Label all boxes with last name, first initial, building, room number.  Forgot your building and room? Check <a href="https://umw.starrezhousing.com/starrezportal">the Housing Portal</a>.
