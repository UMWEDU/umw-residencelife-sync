The residence halls close for:
<ul>
 	<li>everyone except graduates on Saturday, April 30 at 10am</li>
 	<li>graduating students on Sunday, May 8 at 10am.</li>
</ul>
Students wishing to remain on campus after the residence halls close <em>must obtain approval</em> by planning their extended stay and officially requesting it (or having their sponsor request it).

Students found to be on campus without approval will be subject to a $100 per day fine (for each day without approval) and possible judicial action.

Students may not store items in a housing assignment while not present or in between summer dates.  Students must remove all belongings from a housing assignment unless they are assigned for that period.  Spaces will be inspected, abandoned belongings will be discarded within 24 hours of checkout, and handling charges will be applied to the student's account.

Extended stay is outside of the contracted meal plan period. Campus meal service on a pay-per-use basis may or may not be available as the campus dining options are not always open throughout the extended stay period.
<h2>May Extended Stay Application <em>(for student submission)</em></h2>
The <a href="https://orgsync.com/59554/forms/102141">May Extended Stay Application</a> must be submitted electronically no later Tuesday, April 26, 2016. There will be a charge of $30 per day assessed to your student account for extended stay housing (for the number of days you request to be present after the residence halls close).  Requests received after April 26 will be assessed a late submission charge of $25, if approved.  <em>Note:  students needing to stay for a few hours past 10am on April 30 need to complete the form but will not be charged the per day fee.</em>
<h2>Sponsored students <em>(for UMW department sponsorship submission)</em></h2>
Students needing to stay in on-campus housing after the residence hall closing date for official UMW business may be requested by a UMW department.  Examples of students who may be sponsored by a UMW department with legitimate reasons include the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Athletic teams staying to compete</li>
 	<li>Students working Commencement ceremony (graduation usher, etc.)</li>
 	<li>Students attending a scheduled Honor Council / Judicial Review Board hearing</li>
</ul>
Previously identified sponsors will be contacted with specific instructions for submission via email.  If you have not previously sponsored a group for extended stay, contact <a href="mailto:bharper@umw.edu">Brittany Harper</a> no later than Tuesday, April 26, 2016.

There is no housing charge for those sponsored students which are approved for extended stay.
