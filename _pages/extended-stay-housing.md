All residence halls, including Eagle Landing and UMW Apartments, close on May 4, 2019 at 10am. Students are required to vacate their residence hall room and follow all check-out procedures within 24 hours after their last exam or by May 4 at 10am, whichever comes first.

Only students taking summer classes and living in UMW summer housing, graduating students, or students sponsored by a UMW department or office are permitted to have Extended Housing. Graduating seniors will be permitted to stay until Sunday, May 12 at 10am.

Students found to be on campus without approval will be subject to a $100 per day fine (for each day without approval) and possible judicial action.

Students may not store items in a housing assignment while not present or in between summer dates.  Students must remove all belongings from a housing assignment unless they are assigned for that period.  Spaces will be inspected, abandoned belongings will be discarded within 24 hours of checkout, and handling charges will be applied to the student's account.

Extended stay is outside of the contracted meal plan period. Campus meal service on a pay-per-use basis may or may not be available as the campus dining options are not always open throughout the extended stay period.
<h2>May Extended Stay/Late Departure Application <em>(for student submission)</em></h2>
The application for Extended Stay/Late Departure is currently open. All students who wish to remain beyond May 4 must complete the Late Departure form. The <a href="https://umw.starrezhousing.com/StarRezPortal/Login">Late Departure application</a> for Spring 2019 must be submitted electronically no later than April 21, 2019. Submissions after this time may not be able to be accommodated. All reasons for Extended Stay will be verified through graduation lists and departmental sponsors.
