The residence halls close for:
<ul>
 	<li>everyone except graduates on Saturday, May 6 at 10am</li>
 	<li>graduating students on Sunday, May 14 at 10am.</li>
</ul>
Only students taking summer classes and living in UMW summer housing, and graduating students, are permitted to have Extended Housing.

Students found to be on campus without approval will be subject to a $100 per day fine (for each day without approval) and possible judicial action.

Students may not store items in a housing assignment while not present or in between summer dates.  Students must remove all belongings from a housing assignment unless they are assigned for that period.  Spaces will be inspected, abandoned belongings will be discarded within 24 hours of checkout, and handling charges will be applied to the student's account.

Extended stay is outside of the contracted meal plan period. Campus meal service on a pay-per-use basis may or may not be available as the campus dining options are not always open throughout the extended stay period.
<h2>May Extended Stay Application <em>(for student submission)</em></h2>
The <a href="https://orgsync.com/59554/forms/102141">May 2017 Extended Stay Application</a> must be submitted electronically no later than Friday, April 28.
<h2>Sponsored students <em>(for UMW department sponsorship submission)</em></h2>
Students needing to stay in on-campus housing after the residence hall closing date for official UMW business may be requested by a UMW department.  Examples of students who may be sponsored by a UMW department with legitimate reasons include the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Athletic teams staying to compete</li>
 	<li>Students working Commencement ceremony (graduation usher, etc.)</li>
 	<li>Students attending a scheduled Honor Council / Judicial Review Board hearing</li>
</ul>
