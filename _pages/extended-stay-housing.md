The residence halls close for:
<ul>
	<li>everyone except graduates on Saturday, May 2 at 10am</li>
	<li>graduating students on Sunday, May 10 at 10am.</li>
</ul>
Students wishing to remain on campus after the residence halls close <em>must obtain approval</em> by planning their extended stay and officially requesting it (or having their sponsor request it).

A student may be working in the area, wanting to wait until a parent or friend can assist with moving out personal belongings, or wishing to stay to watch a sibling or friend graduate.  Whatever the reason, students must obtain permission by requesting to stay past the closing of the residence halls.  Students found to be on campus without approval will be subject to a $100 per day fine (for each day without approval) and judicial action.

The employment contract end date for Resident Assistants is May 11, so RAs only need to submit a request to stay on campus past the May 11 date.  Students graduating on May 8 or 9 do not need to submit a request to stay on campus past the May 2 hall closing date since the halls close for graduates on Sunday, May 10.  All graduates must check-out of their housing assignment on or before Sunday, May 10.  Those with a special circumstance to stay past May 10 must submit an extended stay request form.

Students may not store items in a housing assignment while not present or in between summer dates.  Students must remove all belongings from a housing assignment unless they are assigned for that period.  Spaces will be inspected, abandoned belongings will be discarded, and handling charges will be applied to the student’s account, in addition to a $100 per day fine (for each day without approval) and possible judicial action.

Extended stay is outside of the contracted meal plan period. Campus meal service on a pay-per-use basis may or may not be available as the campus dining options are not always open throughout the extended stay period.
<h2>May Extended Stay Application <em>(for student submission)</em></h2>
The <a href="https://orgsync.com/59554/forms/102141">May Extended Stay Application</a> must be submitted electronically no later Tuesday, April 28, 2015. There will be a charge of $30 per day assessed to your student account for extended stay housing (for the number of days you request to be present after the residence halls close).  Requests received after April 28 will be assessed a late submission charge of $25, if approved.  <em>Note:  students needing to stay for a few hours past 10am on May 2 need to complete the form but will not be charged the per day fee.</em>
<h2>Sponsored students <em>(for UMW department sponsorship submission)</em></h2>
Students needing to stay in on-campus housing after the residence hall closing date for official UMW business may be requested by a UMW department.  Examples of students which may be sponsored by a UMW department with legitimate reasons include the following:
<ul>
	<li>Athletic teams staying to compete</li>
	<li>Students working Commencement ceremony (graduation usher, etc.)</li>
	<li>Students attending a scheduled Honor Council / Judicial Review Board hearing</li>
</ul>
Sponsors must submit their spreadsheet to <a href="mailto:bharper@umw.edu">Brittany Harper</a> no later than Tuesday, April 28, 2015.  Sponsors should access the spreadsheet here.

There is no housing charge for those sponsored students which are approved for extended stay.  Extended stay is outside of the contracted meal plan period.  Campus meal service on a pay-per-use basis may or may not be available as the campus dining options are not always open throughout the extended stay period. Students remaining on campus during this period of time, or their sponsor, must make dining plans.  For sponsored group meal arrangements, please contact Dining Services.  The Office of Residence Life does not coordinate meal services.
<h2>Summer Housing</h2>
Students wishing to apply for summer housing should complete the <a href="http://www.umw.edu/residencelife/on-campus/summer-housing/">Summer Agreement</a> and indicate their extended stay request (instead of submitting two separate requests).
<h2>Fall 2015 Early Arrivals</h2>
Students wishing to come to campus early in August will need to obtain approval through the Early Arrival process; these students must be sponsored by a University department and need to arrive early for a legitimate reason.  Those without a sponsor with a legitimate reason may request to arrive a couple of days early by submitting an extended stay request (note: there is a $30 per day fee), which will be available late July.
