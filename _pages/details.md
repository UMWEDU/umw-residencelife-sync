<h2><strong>Housing Selection Glossary of Terms</strong></h2>
<em>Group Leader</em>-One member of each roommate group.  The group leader selects the housing assignment at the designated appointment time for all members of the group.

<em>Housing Assignment</em>-the building and room where a student will live for the 2016-2017 year.  The assignment is selected by the individual or the group leader (for roommate groups) in Symplicity Residence during their housing selection appointment.

<em>Housing Selection Appointment</em>-The time at or after which a student can log into Symplicity Residence to select their housing assignment for the 2016-2017 year.

<em>Housing Selection Process</em>-One of three time frames during which students may select a housing assignment for the 2016-2017 year.  Pre-Process (March 7-11), Eagle Landing Double Occupancy Selection Process (March 26 morning), Main Selection Process (March 26 afternoon).

<em>Roommate Group</em>-The group of students that wish to share a room.  These groups are set up in Symplicity Residence by sharing your roommate code.
<h2><strong>Housing Selection Appointment Times</strong></h2>
Students eligible to participate in Housing Selection will receive a Housing Selection appointment time. This is the earliest time a student or group may log into Symplicity Residence to select their housing assignment.  Only the Group Leader will need to select – they will select for the entire group.

Each individual will have a specific individual time slot.  However, if in a group, the group’s best time will be used to select (by the Group’s Leader).  For example:  if Susie has time slot 1:00 pm and Janet has time slot 5:00 pm, the group may select at or after 1:00pm.

For students who want to live in Eagle Landing and who have a preferred roommate you will participate in the Eagle Landing Double Occupancy Selection process on March 26th in the morning.  There will be an opt-in process for students wishing to participate in this process.  This means all roommate groups of 2 wishing to participate in this process must log into <a href="https://umw-residence.symplicity.com">Simplicity Residence</a> and select “opt-in” for this process (during the opt-in period only, March 18-22).

<em>Instructions</em>:  Create a group of 2 with a group leader in Symplicity Residence, log into Symplicity Residence and opt into the Eagle Landing Double Occupancy Selection Process, log into Symplicity Residence at or after your assigned Selection Appointment time to select your housing assignment.

<strong>If your group of 2 would like to share an apartment with another specific group of 2</strong> you will have to sign in at the appointment time of the group with the later appointment time and select to live in the same apartment.  Each groups’ leader will have to log into Symplicity Residence independently and select the same apartment different rooms.  <strong>Example</strong>:  Sarah &amp; Jane would like to share an apartment with Kathy and Cybil.  Sarah’s (group leader) and Jane’s appointment time is 10am while Kathy’s (group leader) &amp; Cybil’s appointment time is 10:30am.  If they want to share an apartment group leaders Kathy &amp; Sarah will log into Symplicity Residence at 10:30am and select the same apartment with one selecting room A and one selecting room B.

<strong>Note:  </strong>Any spaces left in Eagle Landing following the completion of the double occupancy selection process will be added to the main housing selection process as option rooms.

<strong>Note:</strong>  Unfortunately, groups of 3 will not be accommodated during the Eagle Landing Double Occupancy process.  Groups of 3 wanting to live in Eagle Landing will need to participate as individuals during the main process.  All 3 individuals would log into Symplicity Residence at the time of the person with the latest appointment time and select 3 individual spaces in the same apartment.  There are no guarantees that an apartment with 3 spaces will be available at your assigned appointment time.  If it is imperative that your group of 3 live together, we encourage you to consider a 2 bedroom apartment in the UMW Apartments or a triple in a traditional residence hall.
<h2><strong>Main Housing Selection:</strong></h2>
<strong>Note</strong>:  The housing application is due March 13th for individuals wanting to participate in the Main Housing Selection process.

On the afternoon of March 26th, all students who have not previously selected housing will select at or after the assigned appointment time of their roommate group.

During the room selection process, all beds must be filled to 100% capacity (only exception: see “Option Rooms”). For example, a group of three students must select a three-person apartment.

Prior to the process taking place, detailed information will be communicated with housing selection participants on the specific “how-to” instructions to follow in order to electronically select the housing assignment.
<h2><strong>Option Rooms:</strong></h2>
Students are strongly urged to find a roommate for the Housing Selection process.  However, there will be a limited number of Option Rooms available to those students who do not have a group formed [roommate(s)] to fill an entire room or suite.  These students will only have the choice of choosing a space in one of these Option Rooms if a space is available.

The list of designated Option Rooms will be listed in Symplicity Residence after you log in.  This list will be updated throughout the selection process on Saturday.  As it will change, be sure to review it again prior to selecting if you want to know what spaces are Option Rooms.
