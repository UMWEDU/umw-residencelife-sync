<h2><strong>Housing Selection Glossary of Terms</strong></h2>
<em>Group Leader</em>-One member of each roommate group.  The group leader selects the housing assignment at the designated appointment time for all members of the group.

<em>Housing Assignment</em>-the building and room where a student will live for the 2017-2018 year.  The assignment is selected by the individual or the group leader (for roommate groups) in Symplicity Residence during their housing selection appointment.

<em>Housing Selection Appointment</em>-The time at or after which a student can log into Symplicity Residence to select their housing assignment for the 2017-2018 year.

<em>Housing Selection Process</em>-The time frame during which students may select a housing assignment for the 2017-2018 year.  Pre-Process (March 6-10<sup>th</sup>), and Main Selection Process (March 25<sup>th</sup>).

<em>Roommate Group</em>-The group of students that wish to share a room.  These groups are set up in Symplicity Residence by sharing your roommate code.
<h2><strong>Housing Selection Appointment Times</strong></h2>
Students eligible to participate in Housing Selection will receive a Housing Selection appointment time. This is the earliest time a student or group may log into Symplicity Residence to select their housing assignment.  Only the Group Leader is able to select – they will select for the entire group.

Each individual will have a specific individual time slot.  However, if in a group, the group’s best time will be used to select (by the Group’s Leader).  For example:  if Susie has time slot 1:00 pm and Janet has time slot 5:00 pm, the group may select at or after 1:00pm.
<h2><strong>Pre-Process Selection:</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>Main Housing Selection:</strong></h2>
<strong>Note</strong>:  The housing application is due March 10<sup>th</sup> for individuals wanting to participate in the Main Housing Selection process.

On March 28<sup>th</sup>, all students who have not previously selected housing will select at or after the assigned appointment time of their individual or roommate group.

During the room selection process, all beds must be filled to 100% capacity (only exception: see “Open Rooms”). For example, a group of three students must select a three-person apartment.

Prior to the process taking place, detailed information will be communicated with housing selection participants on the specific “how-to” instructions to follow in order to electronically select the housing assignment.
<h2><strong>Open Rooms:</strong></h2>
Students are strongly urged to find a roommate for the Housing Selection process.  However, there will be a limited number of Open Rooms available to those students who do not have a group formed [roommate(s)] to fill an entire room or suite.  These students will only have the choice of choosing a space in one of these Open Rooms.

The list of designated Open Rooms will be listed in Symplicity Residence after you log in.  This list will be updated throughout the selection process on Saturday.  As it will change, be sure to review it again prior to selecting if you want to know what spaces are Open Rooms.

*NOTE: these rooms are not "single" rooms; students who choose to select these spaces without a designated roommate, will have another person assigned to the other open space.
<h4>Resident Assistant Open Room spaces</h4>
There are some Open Rooms available in Resident Assistant apartments.  Students selecting these spaces will need to agree to the terms of living with an RA and sign the RA Roommate Agreement form after selecting (Residence Life staff will later contact you about signing it).
