<h2>Welcome</h2>
As announced on January 20th, in-person instruction will begin on February 1st and residential student move-in will be January 30th and January 31st. We cannot wait to welcome you back to campus. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:reslife@umw.edu">reslife@umw.edu</a>.
<h2>Entry Testing</h2>
New students and returning students will have the same move-in period over the weekend of January 30th and January 31st. This is a change from previous plans where new students had a separate day for move-in. Time slots for move-in will be based on the day and time that students sign up for their COVID entry test. Residents will select a time for testing from those that are available. If you receive a negative result, you will then be able to head to your residence hall or to Eagle Landing to pick up your room key. Students will not be permitted to move into or access their residence hall without completing a UMW-provided entry test and receiving a negative result.

You can sign up for COVID entry testing <a href="https://www.signupgenius.com/go/5080c4aaaaa28a3fd0-covid193">here</a>.

Based on the most recent public health advisories, our guest policy has been revised so that no guests will be allowed in the residence halls during move-in. This includes family members and other residential students who are not part of your residence hall community. We know this will be disappointing, particularly for family members who look forward to the ritual of moving students in. We also recognize that students might need help with accessibility needs as well as belongings. In light of this policy, we want to support you where needed. If you expect you will need assistance with your belongings and/or for other reasons while moving into your residence hall, we will have staff members available to support. So that we may plan the pre-testing and availability of our staff assistance, please contact us at <a href="mailto:reslife@umw.edu">reslife@umw.edu</a> by January 26th and provide a brief description of the assistance you will require. To help your move-in process and reduce unneeded items, remember to pack SMART for the semester and follow the tips that we have compiled <a href="https://www.umw.edu/residencelife/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2020/07/COVID-Eagle-Approved-list-2020.pdf">here</a>.

Housing and meal plan charges are being adjusted to reflect students’ fewer number of days on campus for the Spring semester. Those adjustments will post to students’ accounts early next week and can be viewed in <a href="https://adminfinance.umw.edu/studentaccounts/eaglepay/">EaglePay</a>.
<h3>New Students</h3>
<p class="p1">For entering the hall, you will need an Eagle One card. The Eagle One office will be open on January 30th and January 31st from 10am-2pm.</p>
