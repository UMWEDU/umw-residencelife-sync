Information below will assist students in their on-campus move-in process so they can get settled in and ready for a great fall semester.  Early arrivals will not be permitted unless there is a direct connection with a University-sponsored activity, the sponsor requests the student to return early, and the request is approved; approved early arrivals are notified of their approved early move-in date and time.

If students need to arrive in the Fredericksburg area earlier than permitted, they will need to make arrangements with a local hotel.  Additionally, individuals will not be permitted to move belongings in early.  (Students wishing to move in as early as August 19 may choose to pay $30 per day by <a href="http://students.umw.edu/residencelife/earlyarrival/">submitting a request</a>.)

Once students get to campus, they will need to “check-in,” to obtain their residence key.  Each student must present a valid UMW EagleOne card or a government issued photo ID card to obtain their key.  Once a student has signed for his or her key, he or she may proceed to unload belongings and get established in their new community.
<h2>Make it an easier move-in:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Talk with your roommates to decide what items will be shared (television, rug, mini-fridge, surge protectors, etc.).  For a detailed suggested list of items to bring (and not bring), visit URL:.</li>
	<li>Make sure all of your belongings are packed and labeled with your name and building/room number.</li>
	<li>Bring a hand truck or cart to help move larger items.</li>
	<li>As you unpack, recycle cardboard and other recyclable materials in dumpsters outside the residence halls keeping the hallways clear.  For more information on what to recycle, visit <a href="http://sustainability.umw.edu/recycling/on-campus-recycling/">UMW's sustainability site</a>.</li>
	<li>Dress comfortably.  Keep hydrated.  And ask staff for needed assistance.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Parking</h2>
Students and family members must follow directional signs and the instructions of any assistants giving parking directions.  After unloading belongings, we ask that all vehicles be moved to a more permanent parking location to make room for other students needing to unload.  For maps and directions to campus, visit the <a href="http://www.umw.edu/visitors/">UMW visitor's page</a>.

<h3>Obtaining a Parking Decal:</h3>
Online registration for parking decals will begin on August 1, 2015.  A <strong><em>temporary parking dash pass</em></strong> should be downloaded and displayed in the vehicle dashboard upon arrival on campus.  Permanent decals will be delivered to student UMW campus mailboxes (for both residential and commuter students).  Contact the <a href="http://adminfinance.umw.edu/parking/">Office of Parking Management</a> for inquiries.
<h3>Approved Early Arrivals</h3>
Students who are UMW-sponsored to move in early will be notified by Residence Life of their move-in date.  All will check-in (pick up their key) after 9:00am and before 10pm <em>at the Eagle Landing desk</em>(unless otherwise communicated) – with the exception of those moving in during the times the keys will be deployed in the residence halls for larger move-ins.

<em>Thursday, August 20</em> from 8:00am – 11:30am at residence hall complex (if arriving after 11:30am, 12:30pm at Eagle Landing, Keys will not be available between 11:30am and 12:30pm)

Eagle Landing desk is open for key pick-up from 9:00am until 10:00pm.

Students approved to come to campus early need to follow all parking rules.  Parking management will be enforcing these rules with tickets and fines for those unauthorized to park.  These students should visit the Office of Parking Management in Lee Hall.

This move-in is for those <strong><em>registered</em></strong> for Orientation session #7.  (Those students which participated in a previous Orientation session move in on Thursday, August 20.)  See the <a href="http://orientation.umw.edu">Orientation site</a> for more information on Orientation #7.
<h2><strong><em>New Student Arrival and Welcome</em></strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Freshmen and Transfer Students Move-In</strong></h3>
Thursday, August 20  |  8:00am – 11:30am  | <em> </em><em>Check-in will take place at each residence hall.
</em><a href="http://students.umw.edu/residencelife/unloading/">Unloading information</a> is available according to what dorm you are moving into.
<h2><strong><em>Returning Student Move-In</em></strong></h2>
<h3>Eagle Landing Only Move-In</h3>
Students may move-in during any of the days and times below which is most convenient to their schedule.  In the past, there have been issues with students and families parking in the retail spaces; to maintain good relations with the neighboring businesses, students must avoid parking in the customer lots – even while moving in.  To facilitate a seamless move-in, parking garage floors 3, 4, and 5 will be available for students to more easily park and move belongings into their residence.  Cars must be moved to another location afterwards.  There is no parking in the fire lanes, near yellow curbs, or near dumpsters.  <em>Check-in will take place at Eagle Landing Rotunda.</em>

Thursday, August 20  |  5:00pm – 7:00pm
Friday, August 21  |  5:00pm – 7:00pm
Saturday, August 22  |  12:00pm – 7:00pm
Sunday, August 23   |  9:00am – 12:00pm
<h3><strong>All Other Locations</strong></h3>
<em>Check-in will take place at each residence hall.  </em><strong><em>Keys will not be available prior to the scheduled check-in times.</em></strong>
Saturday, August 22  |  3:00pm – 7:00pm  |  UMW Apartments
Saturday, August 22  |  3:00pm – 5:00pm  | All upper-class students (rest of campus)
Sunday, August 23  |  9:00am – 12:00pm  |  All upper-class students (Eagle Landing, UMW Apartments, and rest of campus).  <em>Students are strongly advised to arrive no later than noon on Sunday, August 23.  Those arriving the afternoon of Sunday, August 23 will go to Eagle Landing to pick-up their key (after 1pm when the keys will be returned there).</em>

Note:  Ball Hall residents wishing to park near the building to unload at move-in are encouraged to arrive on Saturday when this will be possible. Due to new student welcome activities, this will not be possible on Sunday.
