<h2>Welcome</h2>
UMW Move-in is one of Residence Life and Housing’s hallmark events.  We cannot wait to welcome you to campus this August!  Please review the following information in order to make your transition to campus living as smooth as possible.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:reslife@umw.edu">reslife@umw.edu</a>.
<h2>Move-in Dates &amp; Times:<strong>
</strong></h2>
<strong>Wednesday, August 23<sup>rd</sup>, 8:00 a.m. – 2:00 p.m. </strong>—All New and Transfer Students (See Instruction Sheet for the specific time for your room.)
<strong>Saturday, August 26<sup>th</sup>, 8:00 a.m. – 1:00 p.m. </strong>—All Upper-class Students (See Instruction Sheet for the specific time for your room.)
<h2><strong>Sponsored Early Arrivals:</strong></h2>
We are working diligently to prepare campus for your arrival.  The preparation of our residence halls takes careful scheduling throughout the summer and goes up to move-in day.  As such, only those students approved for early arrival will be allowed to check in early.  If you are part of an authorized group (i.e. Orientation Leaders, Athletes, NEST, Move-In Crew, RAs) that has an early move in, then you will be notified of your move in date and time by your group leader.  Please contact your sponsoring group for additional information.  If you are not part of a sponsored group but need to return prior to the posted move-in date, please visit the <a href="http://www.umw.edu/residencelife/before-you-get-to-campus/move-in/early-arrivals/">Early Arrivals</a> page for more information and instructions.
