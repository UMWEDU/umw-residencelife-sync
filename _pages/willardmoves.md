<p class="p3"><b>December 13 - Loft/Bunk Requests: </b>Students who wish to have their beds lofted or bunked prior to moving should make their request to Mary Taylor (mtaylo23@umw.edu) by this date.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>January 8 - Virginia 3rd floor Move: </b>Students living on the 3rd floor of Virginia Hall will move via Moving Crew.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>January 9 - Virginia 2nd floor Move: </b>Students living on the 2nd floor of Virginia Hall will move via Moving Crew.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>January 10 - Virginia 1st floor Move: </b>Students living on the 1st floor of Virginia Hall will move via Moving Crew.</p>

<h2 class="p1">The Details</h2>
<p class="p3">As previously communicated, Residence Life and Housing will be utilizing Apple Transfer, a moving company UMW has on contract and has had wonderful experiences with in these types of situations. Apple Transfer will move personal belongings from Virginia to Willard on the dates outlined on the front of this handout. Willard is furnished with all new furniture; none of your furniture from Virginia will move. In order to prepare for the move, please take note of the following:</p>
<p class="p5">Take home valuables, breakables, and sentimental belongings during Winter Break. You will be able to move them directly into Willard Hall upon your return. <b>Keys to Willard may be picked up at the Eagle Landing desk in January.</b></p>
<p class="p5">Pack all small belongings in duffels, boxes, or bins. NOTE: any type of boxes and/or bags are acceptable; the most important thing is that loose items are contained in some way for easy transport. <i>Please empty all Sterlite plastic drawer systems as they break apart easily when full.</i></p>
<p class="p5">Label all duffels, boxes, and large items with your full name and Willard room #. You can find your Willard room # in your assignment letter email.</p>
<p class="p5">Apple Transfer cannot move animals or fish. Please make plans to move those on your own. They should be going home with you over Winter Break, so you may move them directly to Willard upon your return.</p>
<p class="p5">Let Apple Transfer do the moving for you. If you donâ€™t want Apple to move it, take it home with you.</p>
<p class="p5">When you arrive in January, you will begin spending nights in Willard Hall. You will still have access to Virginia Hall if there are any essentials you need to grab prior to Apple Transfer moving your belongings.</p>

<h2 class="p1">The Day of the Move</h2>
<p class="p3">Apple Transfer with Residence Life professional staff members will arrive to Virginia Hall to begin moving students at 8am each day, January 8-10.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>Students will not have a specific scheduled move time, but instead will be expected to be awake and ready to move before 10am.</b> As you become ready, you will open your door signaling that the movers may come in and start loading your belongings into the large moving bins they will bring. They will load your belongings into as few bins as possible, then bring the bin(s) to the doors facing the Fountain and Willard. The crew will wheel the bins across the Plaza, into Willard, and on to your new room. In the meantime, you will complete a final check of your room in Virginia, go to Willard, and turn in your Virginia key. After, you will proceed to your new room to begin unpacking. The rest of the week is yours to set up, unpack, and explore your new home.</p>
<p class="p3">Two items to keep in mind:</p>

<ol>
 	<li class="p5">Once you open your door in Virginia, it may take a little while until the movers are able to come assist you. <b>Please be patient and allow them the time to get to you, even if it takes an hour.</b> These folks are professionals and will make your move easier; parents and families will not need to move any belongings.</li>
 	<li class="p5">The fewer people in the room the better. Once the movers arrive to your room, you and your roommate should remain in the room, and anyone else should please exit during the move.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="p1">Unavailable?</h2>
<p class="p2">If you are unavailable due to sports or travel on your assigned moving day, it is important for you to contact Residence Life and Housing ASAP to make alternative arrangements. For example, designate your roommate or a friend who can be on campus, to be present for your items.</p>
